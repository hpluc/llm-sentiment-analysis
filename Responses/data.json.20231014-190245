The last Olympic Session was held in India in 1983 in New Delhi.\nPM Modi also said that India wishes to host the 2029 Youth Olympics. \u201cIndians are very excited about hosting the Olympics Games. India will leave no stone unturned in organising the 2036 Olympics,\u201d Modi said during his address to the IOC Session delegation and a host of other invitees at the Jio World Convention Centre.\n\u201cThis is a dream of 140 crore Indians. We want to fulfil this dream with your support. We are willing to host the 2029 Youth Olympics. I am sure India will get constant support from IOC,\u201d PM Modi added.\nIn his address to the gathering, PM Modi touched upon the importance of sports in India\u2019s illustrious history and said that there are hardly any festivals in the country which do not have any spots associated with them.\n\u201cThe spirit of sports is universal,\u201d said PM Modi. \u201cThere are no losers \u2014 there are only winners and learners in sports. Sports empower humanity. Whoever breaks records, everyone welcomes it,\u201d he added.\nIOC president Thomas Bach, who began his address earlier in the evening by greeting the gathering with a \u2018namaste\u2019, told the Indian PM \u2018aapka bahut-bahut swagat hai\u2019 (we welcome you), adding that the country has been on the rise economically and also in sports.\n\u201cIndia is an inspiring place. The entire Olympic community in India can be proud of the Asian Games performance,\u201d Bach said.\nThe IOC president, in his address, highlighted the importance of inclusion of e-sports in the Olympics program, emphasising on the need to trust the mindset of the young people and empower them.\nBach also spoke in details on artificial intelligence, saying an AI working group has been formed and added that more details on it will be revealed during the 141st IOC Session to be held over the next two days. Bach said artificial intelligence and e-sports are two new opportunities for the Olympic movement.\nBach also highlighted the impact that artificial intelligence is going to have on the future Games, saying, \u201cParis Olympics 2024 will be the last Games of the pre-artificial intelligence era.\u201d", "url": "https://www.news18.com/sports/india-ready-to-host-2036-olympics-says-pm-modi-at-mumbai-ioc-session-cites-g20-summit-as-example-8618192.html", "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2023/10/india-olympics-2023-10-27d9104370fc6c7e3693f2a0e2b9348b-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "publishedAt": "2023-10-14T16:30:45Z", "source": {"name": "News18", "url": "https://www.news18.com"}}, {"title": "Blinken asks China to use 'influence' for Middle East calm", "description": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Saturday on China, a partner of Iran, to use its influence to push for calm in the Middle East.Miller said the Middle East was an example of areas where the two powers could work together.", "content": "US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Saudi Arabia late on Friday on a whistlestop Arab tour to push for calm in the Middle East (Jacquelyn Martin)\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Saturday on China, a partner of Iran, to use its influence to push for calm in the Middle East.\nThe top US diplomat, who was visiting Saudi Arabia, had a \"productive\" one-hour telephone call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.\n\"Our message was that he thinks it's in our shared interest to stop the conflict from spreading.\" Miller told reporters on Blinken's plane from Riyadh to Abu Dhabi.\n\"He thought it could be useful if China could use its influence.\"\nChina has a warm relationship with Iran, whose clerical leadership supports both Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist group ruling Gaza that carried out grisly attacks inside Israel a week ago, and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group that could open a second front against Israel.\nWang for his part said that the United States should \"play a constructive and responsible role, pushing the issue back on track for a political settlement as soon as possible,\" according to a readout published by the Chinese foreign ministry.\n\"When dealing with international hot-spot issues, major countries must adhere to objectivity and fairness, maintain calmness and restraint, and take the lead in abiding by international law,\" said Wang.\nThe Chinese foreign minister added that Beijing called for \"the convening of an international peace meeting as soon as possible to promote the reaching of broad consensus\".\n\"The fundamental outlet for the Palestinian issue lies in implementing a 'two-state solution',\" said Wang.\nChina's official statements on the conflict have not specifically named Hamas in their condemnations of violence, leading to criticism from some Western officials who said they were too weak.\nThe United States considers China to be its main global challenger but the two powers have been working to stabilise their relationship, with Blinken paying a rare visit to Beijing in June.\nStory continues\nMiller said the Middle East was an example of areas where the two powers could work together.\nThe phone call also included a discussion on China-US relations, which have been heavily strained in recent years by a range of thorny trade and geopolitical issues.\nBut Wang suggested there were some positive signs.\n\"China and the United States have recently carried out a series of high-level contacts, and bilateral relations appear to have stopped sliding and to stabilise,\" said Wang.\n\"(This) has been welcomed by the people of the two countries and the international community.\"\npfc-sct/kir", "url": "https://sg.news.yahoo.com/blinken-asks-china-influence-middle-140329052.html", "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/afp.com.sg/75c041a8644c8b022339c1b63151411e", "publishedAt": "2023-10-14T14:03:29Z", "source": {"name": "Yahoo Singapore News", "url": "https://sg.news.yahoo.com"}}, {"title": "Kylian Mbappe: Real Madrid hope Jude Bellingham example can finally lure French striker to Spain next summer", "description": "Real Madrid hopeful of using Jude Bellingham example to convince Kylian Mbappe to move to Spain; Real have chased PSG striker for three years but have been unable to strike deal until this point; France striker is out of contract in Paris next summer", "content": "The words travelled to Clairefontaine as rapidly as they were dispensed on a podcast in Spain. \"We hope that Kylian Mbappe will have the same reasoning as Jude Bellingham,\" Jose Manuel Otero, a member of Real Madrid's board of directors, told Remontada Blanca.\nThe subject, as it has been for three years, was the France captain's future. If that talking point feels stale, the framing with Bellingham offers a fresh slant that Real are happy to play on and which has pierced 'Team Mbappe'.\nThe excellence, rocketing status, and Ballon d'Or priming of the England midfielder is not just headline news in the Spanish capital and England.\nTelefoot, the leading French football broadcaster and rights holder for the national team's games, dedicated a show to Bellingham titled 'La Nouvelle Star,' with Zinedine Zidane, Eduardo Camavinga and Aur\u00e9lien Tchouameni all sharing their thoughts on \"le joueur phare de ce debut de saison\" - the flagship player at the start to the season.\nThat segment on the talent \"hors norme\" - extraordinary - is sharply contrasted by another programme offering analysis into Mbappe's stuttering campaign, which was the major question put to France coach Didier Deschamps ahead of the European Qualifier against the Netherlands.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Jude Bellingham has been a revelation since moving to Real Madrid - with manager Carlo Ancelotti recently claiming 'he plays like he's 30'\n\"With everything Kylian had during this summer, he has the right to have, in the hellish pace of matches, a period when he is a little less good and a little less effective,\" he replied.\nIn France, they talk of two versions of Mbappe: the dynamic force before his decision not to activate his one-year option with PSG, leading to a now partially resolved toxic dispute with the club, and a jaded version afterwards.\nIn Madrid, they read the situation differently and trace the forward's stumble back to May 2022 when, on the verge of joining Real, he opted to sign a new contract with PSG instead. At the Spanish giants, they openly declare Bellingham's brilliance not just as a testament to his talent, but to making the right choice - unlike Mbappe.\nReal's pitch to both players was based on two major tenets: you can win the Ballon d'Or with us, you will create history with us. As one executive told Sky Sports News: \"Our message is simple, 'of course there are other options, we are the best one. You can enjoy that knowledge with us, or you can regret from the outside'.\"\nIn the podcast this week, Otero offered another nod. \"Mbappe will achieve glory when he arrives at Real Madrid,\" he said. \"Otherwise, he will wander... It looks like PSG is less powerful than before.\"\nNewcastle's 4-1 pulverising of the French champions in the Champions League may render that final line something of an understatement. PSG are attempting to transform and create a new face with chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi asking for patience.\nThe overriding feeling in France is that Mbappe has run out of it. His decision not to use his one-year option at the club despite the noise, heat and punishment he knew it would bring, instead leaving him as a free agent in the summer, speaks to that.\nThere is a growing belief that Mbappe will leave at the end of the season but forego any loyalty bonuses owed to him.\nImage: Mbappe's PSG were humbled 4-1 by Newcastle at St James' Park last week\n\"That is how it is looking and what very strong sources are telling us,\" L'Equipe's Loic Tanzi says. \"The communication from Mbappe's side is 'we never said that we don't want to renew. Never ever, we just said we don't want to use the option on the current deal and we don't want to leave this summer.' Kylian even said that you never know how a year will go at a club like PSG.\n\"The decision at the moment from Kylian is not to discuss a new contract. There is no discussion now with the club on that. But during the course of the year, PSG will try again and see how it goes. The player will have the final say, he has the power.\"\nMbappe's gift and curse is that he means everything: to his club, to his country and to our vision of how the new era of football should play out.\nWitnessing him at close quarters provided a portrait of a star with the world at his feet but a heaviness on his shoulders.\nThis is Kylian.\nAs Mbappe emerged to a furious chorus of shuttering lenses, jogging slowly and then cantering through the tree-lined path at Clairefontaine during the last international break, a description his mother once used snapped into focus.\nFayza Lamari would observe her son had \"become like Justin Bieber\" after his landscape-shifting breakthrough as an 18-year-old at Monaco.\nThe rest of Mbappe's France team-mates were already on the pitch along with the coaching staff for an open training session attended by thousands.\nThe photographers and broadcast camera crews, though, faced the opposite direction in anticipation of the visuals they needed, the visuals they wanted, the je ne sais quoi.\nThierry Henry, recently appointed coach of the country's U21 side, was on a neighbouring pitch overseeing an intense tactical workout, but he hardly registered.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Kylian Mbappe and Olivier Giroud came together for a delightful training ground goal ahead of France's Euro qualifier against the Netherlands on Friday\nThe attention was clear and undisturbed, in sync with the cries of the crowd: 'Kylian, Kylian, Kylian.'\nFinally, he was in shot. Finally, the show could start. Finally, it truly felt like Les Bleus.\nLamari nailed the comparison to Bieber in one major sense; Mbappe is a bonafide superstar, the celebrity.\nWhere there is a difference - an escalation of the pressure, the greater importance - is the responsibility the player has to French football, the post Messi-Ronaldo era of the sport, his club, and to his country beyond the sport.\nAt 24, he's had to wear so many expectations that it is understandable when he is worn out. \"Kylian Mbappe just wants to play football,\" an official from the French Football Federation says.\n\"He wants to be - and he is - the best footballer in the world. With that, the problem comes that he is also everything to everyone in the country. A tool for politics, a calm voice during rioting, the symbol of hope for his [hometown] Bondy and suburbs like it.\n\"He is a company, a brand. The leader. He is very strong, very clear in his mind, but it is a heavy pressure. We saw what happened over the summer was hard for him. We were worried about Kylian the footballer, but more Kylian the human.\"\nThe reference to Mbappe's spat with PSG, when the club froze him out and threatened to sell him for turning down the contract option before a resolution was found, had dominated the FFF's thoughts.\nHigh-level discussions were held over how to keep their captain match fit, motivated and happy if PSG stuck to their word and kept the 24-year-old among the \"loft\" - the bomb squad without a first-team future that also included Julian Draxler, Gini Wijnaldum and Leandro Paredes.\n\"Mbappe's situation this summer did not help anyone: not him, nor his club, nor me, nor the national team,\" Deschamps would admit.\n\"It's so much the better that the situation has normalised.\"\nHe wants to be - and he is - the best footballer in the world. With that, the problem comes that he is also everything to everyone in the country.\nIn truth, there was confidence in the France set-up that there would be a speedy solution, primarily because \"Kylian Mbappe just wants to play football.\"\nPSG knew this too. It was their greatest trump card. \"One hundred per cent once Kylian realised that the club were serious about not using him for games, he took action,\" explains Tanzi.\n\"He understood that if nothing changed, he would've stayed in the stands, maybe the bench at least during the first few months of the season. Kylian cannot be himself without football, it is his joy. So he told the club, 'OK, let's speak again, let's try and find a solution.'\n\"And that was his decision, because at the end, the discussion was not between his entourage and the club. It was only between him and the president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\"\nTeam Mbappe\nThe word 'entourage' in this industry can elicit images of a wide crew of people, especially concerning such a blockbuster figure.\nMbappe's circle is notoriously small, in comparison, and has been shed over the years. This is instructive in explaining why throughout the summer standoff with his employers, there was only one side of the story carried by media outlets in France and beyond: PSG's.\nBar the player, who has the final say on all matters, the most critical person in his trusted core is his mother, Lamari. Senior Real Madrid officials refer to her as 'La jefa' - the boss - although she counters that at every opportunity, pointing out she works for Mbappe and \"he is in charge.\"\nPrevious coaches like Antonio Riccardi would agree. At six, the kid who would insist he was \"born to football, for football\" could belt out La Marseillaise and would say it was in preparation to represent the national team at a World Cup.\nMbappe absorbed Spanish and English lessons at school with a focus on how he would address the media as a professional player, even holding mock press conferences as a pre-teen.\n\"Kylian had no doubt of where and how far he wanted to go in football,\" Riccardi noted.\nAs far back as 2018 though, one former sporting director of a Premier League club was wise that \"if you want to get in Mbappe's ear, you have to get his mum onside.\"\nSince the attacker won the World Cup, Lamari's influence has been greater than that of Wilfried, the forward's father from whom she separated in 2021 and who initially sketched his footballing direction as coach of Bondy's U15s.\nImage: Kylian Mbappe attended the FIFA Best Awards last year alongside his father\nTheir contrasting personalities and approaches to Mbappe's career are understood to have been helpful in ensuring situations are maximised.\nFormer professional handball player Lamari is the exacting negotiator who does not give clubs an inch. Cameroon-born Wilfried is described as the \"soother\" who ensures relationships with power brokers don't turn sour.\nLong before this equilibrium saw Real Madrid and PSG contort in ways they've never previously done to secure a signing - the former by ceding image rights, the latter permitting only Mbappe the option of an incredibly lucrative two-year contract, giving him all the power - Nike were supplying him with free boots from the age of 10 and locked him into a proper deal at 12.\nBack then he attended a trial at Chelsea, who wanted to see him develop further before making a commitment. Lamari told them they'd regret that decision.\nAt 14, as illustrated in his graphic novel 'Je m'appelle Kylian,' Mbappe was meeting his idol Cristiano Ronaldo and had an audience with Zidane as Real's long pursuit began.\n\"Maybe you can say it's easy to do a great negotiation when you are representing such an obvious talent,\" says an agent from CAA, specialising in France. \"But it can be a lot more complex because from a very young age, there are people who want to have their tentacles in the situation to profit somehow.\n\"You can have clubs behaving with more aggression and cunning means, because they really want the player. I have to really give Mbappe's family credit. It's not just about the deals - and by the way, what they got out of PSG, wow - but they do not let outside influences corrupt their project.\"\nImage: Mbappe scored 15 Ligue 1 goals as Monaco lifted the title in 2016/17, before he had even turned 19\nLeading into last year's World Cup, Zlatan Ibrahimovic fired a broadside at Lamari and Wilfried, believing they had convinced Mbappe to snub Real and stay in Paris. \"So his parents become lawyers, agents, coaches,\" the Swede told Canal Plus.\n\"From one thing, they become another. And that's the problem. That's when you lose your self-discipline and who you are.\n\"Today with this new generation, the parents, dad, mom who you want, they think they have become stars.\n\"They talk in the newspapers. But who do you think you are? Shut up. It is up to your son, the player, to work and have discipline.\"\nThe pair laughed off the criticism as jealousy and Ibrahimovic courting headlines. It did not frazzle them: they serve their son, \"not outside opinions\".\nMbappe's parents are aided by the lawyer Delphine Verheyden, hired in 2015 over five other legal experts despite them having experience of the football industry. Their downfall was being enamoured by the commission they stood to make - even when the player was just 16.\nVerheyden, who represents some of France's great Olympians, did not care for the sport nor a cut of big contracts: she would charge Team Mbappe her usual hourly rate. For the past five years, she has been considered part of the player's 'equipe de force,' chiefly with Lamari.\nKylian's younger brother, Ethan, in PSG's academy and his adopted sibling, Jires Kembo Ekoko, who is also a professional footballer, complete the inner circle.\nImage: Ethan Mbappe (left) was called up to the PSG squad for the first time last month\nThe initials of each of the family member's first names make up KEWJF - the company which was born to handle Mbappe's public relations and commercial obligations and boasts a turnover in the multi-millions.\nAgence Patricia Goldman, an independent communications consulting agency specialising in image strategy and media relations, advises some of the biggest companies in the world like Coca-Cola... and advises Mbappe.\nIf there was one curious move made by this juggernaut team over the summer, it was the choice of silence during the standoff with PSG, which allowed the club to fully control the narrative over the situation.\nPart of this was the suggestion that by leaving as a free agent, Mbappe would cripple the club financially, putting them in the position where they would need to sell off some of his team-mates.\n\"It was unfair coverage because Mbappe's entourage chose not to speak so we didn't have information from his side,\" Tanzi explains.\n\"That was a problem, we only had one version which was the club's. Obviously, they will have to tell us what is in their best interests. I do think it was a mistake on Mbappe's side because they should have at least spoken to the press off the record to clarify some points and it would have helped with making the supporters more understanding too.\n\"What we were told is Kylian told the club he won't use his option to extend. That was the communication and they said there was nothing more to add.\"\nThere has been disappointment from those covering France that Mbappe has swerved doing the traditional pre-match press conferences in his capacity as skipper alongside Deschamps for months.\nHe does not want his future, nor the fall-out over the summer, to distract from the national team. What he has to say about or to PSG will come in time. He does not want to be misinterpreted or misrepresented.\nSix months ago, Mbappe blasted the club for using a standard in-house interview with him as part of a marketing campaign to sell season tickets. He felt his image and brand were being taken advantage of.\n\"PSG is not Kylian Saint-Germain,\" he wrote as part of a post on Instagram.\nIn truth, in Paris, it's all about Mbappe. In France now, he is their symbol of football.\nNot \"like Justin Bieber\", because he is more important. But bigger than Bellingham? Not right now, while the midfielder's star rises in Madrid and Mbappe - for the time being anyway - is on the outside looking in.", "url": "https://www.skysports.com/football/news/37134/12983724/kylian-mbappe-real-madrid-hope-jude-bellingham-example-can-finally-lure-french-striker-to-spain-next-summer", "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/23/07/1600x900/skysports-kylian-mbappe-psg_6211642.jpg?20230707165118", "publishedAt": "2023-10-14T06:20:00Z", "source": {"name": "Sky Sports", "url": "https://www.skysports.com"}}, {"title": "Resilience and Returns: The Dual Appeal of Canadian Dividend Stocks", "description": "TD is an example of a stock that has demonstrated its resilience and survived and thrived despite numerous crises.", "content": "TD is an example of a stock that has demonstrated its resilience and survived and thrived despite numerous crises.\nResilience \u2013 it\u2019s what separates success and failures. When it comes to dividend stocks, resilience means a lot of things. Most of all, it means consistent, growing dividends. There are a few Canadian dividend stocks that show this over time, and these are the stocks that I\u2019ll explore in this article.\nLong-term survival requires resilience\nLet\u2019s look at the Canadian banks as an example of this. Toronto-Dominion Bank (TSX:TD), one of Canada\u2019s top two banks, is demonstrating tons of resilience and delivering ample returns over the long run.\nIn our search for the best Canadian dividend stocks, we need look no further than TD stock, whose stock price graph can be found below.\nHere we see that over the last 35 years, the stock has provided its shareholders with a more than 1,700% return. But there\u2019s more. During this time period, TD stock has also paid out consistent and growing dividends. In fact, since 1995, the bank\u2019s annual dividend has grown from $0.22 per share to the current $3.84. That\u2019s 1,645.5% higher, for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.7%.\nBut how could TD have thrived during these last 35 years, through numerous crises and macroeconomic headwinds? Well, the answer is actually quite simple \u2013 resilience. This resilience is evidenced in the simple fact that the bank has continued to generate healthy returns throughout these years. Through the credit crisis of 2008, the recession in the early 1990s, and so many other events, TD bank has survived and ultimately thrived.\nResilience requires a competitive advantage\nOne thing that does not get talked about enough is the idea of a competitive advantage. A competitive advantage really drives resilience and ensures that a company is protected from competitors that are vying for a piece of the pie.\nSo, what is a competitive advantage? Well, simply put, a competitive advantage is something that puts a company in a superior position relative to its peers. This advantage can take the form of cost leadership, differentiation, operational excellence, and branding, to name just a few.\nCanadian Natural Resources Ltd. (TSX:CNQ) is a good example of a company that has clear competitive advantages. For example, it\u2019s one of the lowest-cost oil and gas producers. Also, its assets are top tier, which means that they are long-life assets with low decline rates. This also means that they have longevity, resiliency, and require relatively little in the way of capital investment to keep them producing.\nUltimately, this has resulted in a long history of solid returns for CNQ stock. For example, the stock price has returned more than 2,100% since 2001. Also, Canadian Natural\u2019s dividend has increased 7,100% since 2001, making it one of the best Canadian dividend stocks.\nA healthy balance sheet facilitates a growing dividend\nLastly, I cannot stress enough the importance of maintaining a healthy balance sheet. This is paramount to success and long-term survival. A healthy balance sheet is a simple concept that can also be applied to our own personal finances. The more debt you have, the more you risk something going awry.\nWhile corporations really do need to take on a level of debt in order to grow and maintain their competitive advantage, they must also ensure that they spend wisely and carefully. There\u2019s nothing that can get a company, even a bank, in trouble more quickly than taking on a reckless amount of debt.\nBoth TD stock and Canadian Natural Resources have been consistent in their drive to maintain a healthy balance sheet. TD Bank has been well-capitalized over the years, and the bank has maintained policies that are conducive to maintaining this by avoiding high risk business and maintaining a conservatism that keeps it grounded.", "url": "https://www.fool.ca/2023/10/13/resilience-and-returns-the-dual-appeal-of-canadian-dividend-stocks/", "image": "https://www.fool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/grow.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-10-14T01:15:00Z", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool Canada", "url": "https://www.fool.ca"}}, {"title": "Transport dept nod to premium bus, cab aggregator policies", "description": "The government has also set a timeline for the aggregators to convert to electric vehicles.

The policy has been sent to Chief Minister Kejriwal for approval,\u201d Gahlot added.\nUnder the cab aggregator policy, rules and legalisation of \u2018Bike Taxis\u2019, aggregators providing passenger services and delivery services providers etc, were proposed.

Assucena remains the more optimistic of the two, and the couple\u2019s fraught emotional dissonance is partly why, together, she and Cuevas are so intoxicating.\nAdvertisement\nJos\u00e9 Pablo Castro Cuevas and Amanda Assucena in Joffrey Ballet's \"Frankenstein\" at Lyric Opera House. (Cheryl Mann/HANDOUT)\nDole spends a fair portion of the ballet lying on a slab in a gothic operating theater or, later, crouching behind leafless trees at Frankenstein\u2019s Swiss chalet, spying on his maker. His looming presence is a tease, and just a fraction of what makes \u201cFrankenstein\u201d provokingly thrilling.\nAt university, Frankenstein and his best mate, Henry (Xavier Nu\u0301n\u0303ez), the latter bullied by an ensemble of boisterous, braggadocios classmates, learn anatomy and cadaver dissection. As those less serious scholars pal around at the pub with a few comfortably numb courtesans, Cuevas steals away to the lab on his own and, using a set of steampunk contraptions, drives electric current into Dole\u2019s inanimate body, bringing life to a pile of flesh.\nThe scene is an example of ballet at its finest, with some of the world\u2019s best artists coming together to make inconceivable theatrical magic. Troy Fujimura (projections), Gateway Pyrotechnic Productions, David Finn (lighting), John Macfarlane (scenic and costumes), Liebermann (whose score is realized by music director Scott Speck and arrestingly performed by the Lyric Opera Orchestra), and, of course, Scarlett have created a perfect container. It is then on the dancers to do it. And they nailed it. This must be how audiences felt the first time they saw Marie Taglioni rise onto her toes as a sylph then fly above the stage on invisible guide wires: wonder-filled. It\u2019s magical.\nJos\u00e9 Pablo Castro Cuevas in Joffrey Ballet's \"Frankenstein\" at Lyric Opera House. (Cheryl Mann/HANDOUT)\nAnd as Creature, Dole gives the performance of his life thus far. In just four seasons, he now emerges as a dancer to watch, tackling all the complexity of an unnamed wretch conflicted by an inexplicable, insatiable need to sow chaos \u2014 not to mention some really hard dancing. The Creature is tormented by an uncontrollable urge to inflict physical pain. He\u2019s more conniving, though, in imposing psychological trauma, a nuance Dole makes masterfully clear. This is perhaps most evident in a brilliant ballroom scene, which has Creature weaving in and among a dizzying mass of waltzing couples. He vanishes then appears again and again, each time with a smirk on his mangled lips \u2014 then he destroys Frankenstein\u2019s family.\nDole, Cuevas and Assucena are just a few of the thrilling performances on offer in \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d not least of which include Jeraldine Mendoza as Justine, the household friend falsely accused of killing William, brilliantly danced by young Sheppard Littrell. As usual, keep an eye out for discerning character roles by Christine Rocas and Miguel Angel Blanco, the latter back in the fray after departing the company last season. And there\u2019s terrific, intricate ensemble work as the cherry on top.\nSpoiler: Everybody dies. Plot twist: The manner and order by which many of these characters take their last breaths have been changed from the original.\nMary Shelley has Victor Frankenstein dying of illness while trying to kill Creature, hoping to save others from enduring his family\u2019s fate. In his last rite, he implores those around him to continue that mission.\n\u201cI created a rational creature and was bound toward him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and well-being,\u201d says Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein. \u201cMiserable himself that he may render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was mine, but I have failed.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHere, Frankenstein makes a mess and, overcome with grief, can\u2019t endeavor to try and clean it up. Scarlett\u2019s Frankenstein kills himself with a pistol, leaving Creature to mourn his maker and walk into a towering wall of fire.\nIt is the acts of men which deprived the wretch of his most basic needs: compassion and companionship. Scarlett does not make clear that Frankenstein makes a choice to deny Creature a partner when given the chance to spare his family. Frankenstein creates a monster not by his hand, but by his deeds.\n\u201cAm I to be thought the only criminal,\u201d says Shelley\u2019s Creature, \u201cwhen all humankind sinned against me?\u201d\nTheater Loop Weekly Get the latest news and reviews from America's hottest theater city, delivered to your mailbox weekly.

(Image credit: Graphics by Julio Lacerda. \u00a9NLD)\nScientists have identified what could be the earliest evidence of Neanderthals killing a cave lion, likely by creeping up behind it while it was resting and stabbing it in the abdomen, ancient bones uncovered in Germany reveal.\nA puncture wound in one of the lion's ribs indicates the weapon pierced vital organs before getting lodged in the animal's chest. The hunt took place about 48,000 years ago, during the Middle Paleolithic (300,000 to 30,000 years ago).\nPrevious studies of the cave lion's near-complete skeleton \u2014 which researchers unearthed in Siegsdorf, in southern Germany, in 1985 \u2014 revealed cut marks on several bones, suggesting Neanderthals butchered it. But until now, it remained unclear whether our relatives hunted the animal or simply scavenged its carcass.\n\"The new finds from Siegsdorf contribute a unique snapshot into the lives of late Middle Paleolithic foragers,\" researchers wrote in a new study, published Thursday (Oct. 12) in the journal Scientific Reports . \"Our analysis demonstrates for the first time that Neanderthals were capable of actively hunting cave lions using simple wooden spears.\"\nRelated: Neanderthal DNA may shape how sensitive you are to pain, genetic analysis shows\nThe Neanderthals are an extinct lineage of humans, or hominins, that emerged around 400,000 years ago and disappeared 40,000 years ago. They are modern humans' closest known relatives and interbred with our species (Homo sapiens). The Neanderthals were skilled hunters and butchered large carnivores for consumption and cultural or symbolic purposes, according to the study.\nThe cave lion remains from Siegsdorf are displayed alongside a reproduction of a wooden spear similar to those used by Neanderthals. (Image credit: Volker Minkus. \u00a9NLD)\nThe puncture on the cave lion (Panthera spelaea) bone is angled and resembles lesions found on deer vertebrae that are known to have been inflicted by Neanderthal wooden spears, according to the study. The lack of tooth marks on the lion's ribs and the shape of the puncture exclude the possibility that another predator killed it.\nAfter Neanderthal hunters slaughtered the cave lion, they likely stripped the carcass, cutting away the meat and viscera and abandoning the rest. Cut marks indicate it was butchered at the kill site, the team wrote, adding the lion was probably in \"poor condition\" when it died.\nThe new study also found what may be the earliest evidence of Neanderthals using a cave lion pelt, potentially as clothing or bedding.\nResearchers found cut marks on toe bones from three cave lions dating to between 55,000 and 45,000 years ago that suggest the animals were skinned and their claws preserved. The bones \u2014 excavated in 2019 from the Einhornh\u00f6hle, or unicorn cave, in central Germany \u2014 were unpolished, intact and lacked any distinctive features associated with bones used as pendants or in clothing, prompting the researchers to think the claws were left within lion pelts.\n\"This rare evidence shows that Middle Paleolithic hominins could carefully process large carnivore furs to leave aesthetic elements such as claws in place,\" they wrote in the study.\nBoth discoveries \"provide new information regarding the behavioral complexity of Neanderthals,\" they added.", "url": "https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/oldest-evidence-of-neanderthals-hunting-cave-lions-dates-to-48000-years-ago-punctured-bones-reveal", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fkq7hmm6tcVgneaQXAuUqP-1200-80.png", "publishedAt": "2023-10-13T13:23:03Z", "source": {"name": "Livescience.com", "url": "https://www.livescience.com"}}, {"title": "passions and responsibilities in a drama example of an exquisite director", "description": "There are some particularly interesting things in the adaptation that Greta Gerwig made for one of our years of 'Mujercitas'.

Netanyahu alleged atrocities, including binding boys and girls and shooting them in the head, burning people alive, raping women and beheading soldiers. The prime minister\u2019s allegations could not be independently confirmed.\nArmed settlers have rampaged through West Bank villages and hurled stones at passing Palestinian cars, residents say.

Others sought shelter in the shrinking number of safe neighborhoods.\nThe U.N. humanitarian office said Israeli strikes have leveled 1,000 homes since the retaliation began last Saturday, with another 560 housing units severely damaged and rendered uninhabitable. It said an Israeli cutoff has resulted in dire water shortages for over 650,000 people. Sewage systems have been destroyed, sending fetid wastewater into the streets.\nEgypt\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it has not officially closed the Rafah crossing but that Israeli airstrikes have prevented it from operating. Egypt has engaged in intensive talks with Israel and the United States to allow the delivery of aid and fuel through Rafah, the only Gaza crossing not controlled by Israel.\nBut it has pushed back against proposals to establish corridors out of Gaza, saying an exodus of Palestinians would undermine their hopes of one day establishing an independent state. Egypt is also likely concerned about a potential influx of hundreds of thousands of displaced people.\nThe death toll in Gaza rose to more than 1,350 killed, the Palestinian health ministry said.\nThe Israeli military said more than 1,300 people, including 222 soldiers, have been killed in Israel, a staggering toll unseen since the 1973 war with Egypt and Syria that lasted weeks.\nThousands have been wounded on both sides.\nIsrael says roughly 1,500 Hamas militants were killed inside Israel, and that hundreds of the dead inside Gaza are Hamas members.\n___\nShurafa reported from Gaza City, Gaza Strip.

AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.\nJERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Palestinians lined up outside bakeries and grocery stores in Gaza on Thursday after spending the night surrounded by the ruins of pulverized neighborhoods darkened by a near-total power outage. Israel launched new airstrikes and said it was preparing for a possible ground invasion.\nInternational aid groups warned that the death toll in Gaza could mount after Israel stopped all deliveries of food, water, fuel and electricity and the tiny enclave's crossing with Egypt is closed. The war \u2014 which was ignited by a bloody and wide-ranging assault on Israel by Hamas militants \u2014 has already claimed at least 2,600 lives on both sides.\nLt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters Thursday that forces \u201care preparing for a ground maneuver\" should political leaders order one. A ground offensive in Gaza, whose 2.3 million residents are densely packed into a sliver of land only 40 kilometers (25 miles) long, would likely bring even higher casualties on both sides in brutal house-to-house fighting.\nAs Israel pounds Gaza, Hamas fighters have fired thousands of rockets into Israel since their weekend assault. Militants in the territory are also holding an estimated 150 people taken hostage from Israel.\nPalestinians fleeing airstrikes could be seen running through the streets, carrying their belongings and looking for a safe place. Tens of thousands have crowded into U.N.-run schools while others are staying with relatives or even strangers who let them in.\nLines formed outside bakeries and grocery stores during the few hours they dared open, as people tried to stock on food before shelves are emptied. On Wednesday, Gaza\u2019s only power station ran out of fuel and shut down, leaving only lights powered by scattered private generators.\nA senior official with the the International Committee of the Red Cross warned that the lack of electricity could cripple hospitals.\n\u201cAs Gaza loses power, hospitals lose power, putting newborns in incubators and elderly patients on oxygen at risk. Kidney dialysis stops, and X-rays can\u2019t be taken,\u201d said Fabrizio Carboni, ICRC\u2019s regional director. \u201cWithout electricity, hospitals risk turning into morgues.\u201d\nIsraeli Energy Minister Israel Katz said nothing would be allowed into Gaza until the captives were released. \u201cNot a single electricity switch will be flipped on, not a single faucet will be turned on, and not a single fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages are returned home,\u201d he tweeted.\nAfter Hamas militants stormed into Israel on Saturday and massacred hundreds of people in their homes, on the streets and at an outdoor music festival, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to \u201ccrush and destroy\u201d the group, which has governed Gaza since 2007.\n\u201cEvery Hamas member is a dead man,\u201d Netanyahu said in a televised address late Wednesday.\nThe Israeli government is under intense public pressure to topple the militant group rather than continuing to try to bottle it up in Gaza after four previous conflicts ended with Hamas still firmly in charge of the territory. Israel has mobilized 360,000 reservists, massed additional forces near Gaza and evacuated tens of thousands of residents from nearby communities.\nNetanyahu now has the backing of a new war Cabinet that includes a longtime opposition politician.\nThe U.S. has also pledged unwavering support, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Tel Aviv on Thursday to meet with Israeli leaders. He plans to meet Friday with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority is confined to the occupied West Bank, and Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah II.\nIsrael captured the West Bank, along with Gaza and east Jerusalem, in a 1967 war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state, but there have been no peace talks in over a decade.\nIn Gaza, the Israeli military said overnight strikes targeted Hamas' elite Nukhba forces, including command centers used by the fighters who attacked Israel on Saturday, and the home of a senior Hamas naval operative that it said was used to store unspecified weapons. Other airstrikes killed commanders from two smaller militant groups, according to media linked to those organizations.\n\u201cRight now we are focused on taking out their senior leadership,\u201d Hecht, the military spokesman, said of Hamas. \u201cNot only the military leadership, but also the governmental leadership, all the way up to (top Hamas leader Yehia) Sinwar.\u201d\nDrone footage filmed by The Associated Press revealed extensive damage at the Shati refugee camp, on the Mediterranean coast in the north of Gaza, following overnight airstrikes. Residents picked their way through the rubble as fire and rescue crews looked for survivors.\nWhile Israel has insisted that it is giving notice of its strikes, it is employing a new tactic of leveling whole neighborhoods, rather than just individual buildings. And Israeli military briefings have emphasized the destruction wrought.\nHecht said Israel was not \u201cdoing carpet bombing, though some people would like to see that.\u201d He said targeting decisions were based on intelligence and civilians were warned.\nEven with the evacuation warnings, Palestinians say some are unable to escape or have nowhere to go, and that entire families have been crushed under rubble.\nOther times, strikes come with no notice, survivors say.\n\u201cThere was no warning or anything,\u201d said Hashem Abu Manea, 58, who lost his 15-year-old daughter, Joanna, when a strike late Tuesday leveled his home in Gaza City.\nMeanwhile, the Palestinian Health Ministry said two Palestinians were killed in the West Bank on Thursday when Israeli settlers sprayed bullets at a funeral for three people killed in a settler rampage the day before. Footage showed Jewish settlers in their cars swerving into the funeral procession and cutting off the road before stopping and opening fire.\nShock, grief and demands for vengeance against Hamas are running high in Israel since Saturday's assault. Netanyahu alleged atrocities, including binding boys and girls and shooting them in the head, burning people alive, raping women and beheading soldiers. The prime minister\u2019s allegations could not be independently confirmed.\nArmed settlers have rampaged through West Bank villages and hurled stones at passing Palestinian cars, residents say. The Health Ministry says 28 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and two in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem since Saturday.\nThe U.N. said late Wednesday the number of people displaced by the airstrikes had soared 30% within 24 hours, to 339,000, two-thirds of them crowding into U.N. schools. Others sought shelter in the shrinking number of safe neighborhoods.\nThe U.N. humanitarian office said Israeli strikes have leveled 1,000 homes since the retaliation began last Saturday, with another 560 housing units severely damaged and rendered uninhabitable. It said an Israeli cutoff has resulted in dire water shortages for over 650,000 people. Sewage systems have been destroyed, sending fetid wastewater into the streets.\nEgypt\u2019s Foreign Ministry said it has not officially closed the Rafah crossing but that Israeli airstrikes have prevented it from operating. Egypt has engaged in intensive talks with Israel and the United States to allow the delivery of aid and fuel through Rafah, the only Gaza crossing not controlled by Israel.\nBut it has pushed back against proposals to establish corridors out of Gaza, saying an exodus of Palestinians would undermine their hopes of one day establishing an independent state.

A shutdown is for them welcome, no matter how inconvenient for working people in government, and in the wider economy.\nRight-wing Republicans threatened to oust Boehner if he permitted a federal budget to be passed which included funding for Planned Parenthood. Controversial videos which allege a callous attitude by that organization regarding use of fetuses greatly stoked the always emotional debate over abortion.\nIn 2013, Republicans managed to shut down the government for 16 days as part of the effort to derail the Affordable Care Act. Then as later, Democrats led by President Barack Obama used the Republican effort for partisan political advantage.\nBoehner retired under that pressure, thereby heading off another shutdown.\nThe practice of holding the federal budget hostage to controversial partisan party maneuvers has now gone on for many years.\nIn 1994, Republicans took control of the House after 40 years in minority status. Their majority was led by new speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who dramatically accelerated the trend of shifting that office from a relatively nonpartisan to highly partisan pulpit.\nThen as now, White House Democrats and congressional Republicans played an escalating game of budgetary chicken.

The company raised over $5.3 billion in funding, including one whopping $1.47 billion round in 2020. As it turns out, that money wasn\u2019t sufficient to compete in China\u2019s EV market, where automakers are crumpling under pressure to introduce new smart features and luxury products at increasingly lower price points.\nWM Motor blamed macro-economic conditions for its demise. The carmaker said it\u2019s been struggling to deal with operational issues since the pandemic, capital market stagnation, difficulty securing capital and price volatility in raw materials.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on the auto industry should not be underestimated. Automakers around the world were put under a significant stress test as they grappled with factory closures, logistics disruptions, and subsequent price increases in semiconductors amid a period of chip shortage. Then when Chinese EV makers finally emerged from behind the cloud after the pandemic, a new round of price war initiated by Tesla further strained their cash flow management.\nBut, as Lei Xing, co-host of China EVs and More podcast and former chief editor at China Auto Review, points out, every automaker is under the strain of those conditions \u2014 the ones with deep pockets and operational excellence will survive. And those that are too slow, like WM, won\u2019t be able to make up enough revenue to cover their sizable losses.\nAnd WM\u2019s losses are great. In the three years ending in 2021, the company\u2019s losses mounted to $1.13 billion, according to WM\u2019s stock prospectus released in June 2022 for a planned Hong Kong IPO. That IPO didn\u2019t happen, nor did a planned backdoor listing via a reverse takeover with Apollo Future Mobility that was meant to go through this year.\nIn September, U.S.-listed Chinese used-car dealer Kaixin Auto Holdings said it signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire WM Motor, but the status of that deal is not clear in light of the bankruptcy filing.\nWM Motor has signaled its intent to reorganize and introduce strategic investors from around the world to \u201cachieve its rebirth,\u201d according to a statement posted on the company\u2019s Weibo account Tuesday.\nDespite what the company says, Xing says he doesn\u2019t see a future for WM.\n\u201cEven the leaders \u2014 Nio, XPeng, Li Auto \u2014 they\u2019re by no means out of the woods,\u201d Xing told TechCrunch. \u201cIf you look to the U.S. and Rivian\u2019s convertible note offering, it means they needed money. So capital is still a problem for everyone.\u201d\nIndeed, Nio reported losses of $35,000 per car sold in the second quarter of this year. The company employs 11,000 people in R&D, but sold only 8,000 cars per month from April to June. It has invested heavily in robots in its factories, offers $350 augmented reality glasses for each seat in its cars and has introduced a cellphone that interacts with the car\u2019s self-driving system.\nLi Auto, which appears to be winning with a strong delivery streak this year, could also be caught off guard by a new rival. Aito, a Huawei-backed EV brand produced by Seres, is moving quickly in the smart SUV EV space, Li Auto\u2019s bread and butter. The startup received more than 50,000 orders for its revamped M7 model within the first 25 days it went on sale, putting it among China\u2019s five top-selling new energy vehicle manufacturers, according to August sales data. The M7 has all the features of Li Auto\u2019s popular S7 SUV, but at a sub-$40,000 price point.\nThese are mere examples of the costs Chinese automakers are willing to incur and the speed at which they can move in order to meet and exceed the high expectations from consumers. It\u2019s akin to how consumers around the world have become accustomed to getting a ride in a private vehicle for a fraction of the cost of a taxi. And as we\u2019ve seen from ride-hail companies like Uber and Lyft, slashing prices will result in scale, but it\u2019ll cost companies profits.\n\u201cNone of these smart EV startups are safe, let alone the ones that are state-owned,\u201d said Xing. \u201cLook at Rising Auto, IM, Voyah. These are delivering a couple thousand units a month. It\u2019s not sustainable. I believe you will see some of those dying out, as well.\u201d\nOver the past year, a range of EV startups \u2014 like Evergrande New Energy Auto, Aiways and Niutron \u2014 have either closed factories or stopped taking new orders. Byton, which was backed by Nanjing City government and state-owned carmaker FAW Group, filed for bankruptcy in June after failing to bring its first model, the M-Byte SUV, to production.\nAutomakers like BYD will likely be able to weather the storm, said Xing. BYD is the top EV-maker in China, with over 1.6 million units sold from January to August this year, according to China Passenger Car Association data. Tesla China, the second-largest automaker in the country, sold 390,222 units in that same timeframe.\n\u201cBYD still has additional cards to play,\u201d said Xing. \u201cThey can still cut prices as soon as they need to do so because, like Tesla, they have vertical integration and their cost base is lower than other competitors, so they can sacrifice profitability for volume.\u201d\nCompanies that have a large overseas presence \u2014 like Tesla and Geely \u2014 may also be able to stay afloat because they\u2019ll survive the domestic consumption headwinds.\nZeekr, Geely\u2019s young EV brand backed with hundreds of millions of dollars, for example, is pushing aggressively into international markets with a two-pronged strategy. On the one hand, it plans to soon start selling its luxury EVs in a handful of countries across Asia and Europe; on the other, it has an ongoing deal with Waymo to supply the latter\u2019s robotaxis, which are expected to start testing in the U.S. by the end of this year.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/10/wm-motors-bankruptcy-highlights-challenges-faced-by-ev-startups-in-china/", "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1232535851.jpg?resize=1200,800", "publishedAt": "2023-10-11T02:54:07Z", "source": {"name": "TechCrunch", "url": "https://techcrunch.com"}}, {"title": "'Shameful': OAS accuses Guatemala prosecutors of election interference", "description": "Guatemalan prosecutors are seeking to block the landslide winner of the country's presidential election from taking office, the head of the Organization of American States (OAS) said Tuesday, denouncing the push as a \"shameful example for the hemisphere.\"", "content": "[1/3] Demonstrators block an avenue as part of a national strike to demand the resignation of authorities from the attorney general's office, in Guatemala City, Guatemala October 10, 2023.

What emergency warranted this hasty recall? Civil disorder? Flood relief? Declaration of war?\nClose: it was to pass a law requiring children under 16 to obtain parental consent before changing their pronouns at school. You can see how time would be of the essence here. After all, if the legislation were not passed this week, it would have to be passed two weeks from now.\nWell, no. What\u2019s really driving the government\u2019s haste is the desire to be seen to be \u201cstanding up to the courts.\u201d No legislation is needed to put the policy into effect: it was implemented by regulation back in August. Such was the haste with which it was put together, however \u2013 drafted and implemented inside of five days \u2013 that a judge was persuaded to order a pause before it went into effect, on Charter of Rights grounds.\nThe judge did not overturn the regulation, understand. He simply directed the government to take some time to assess its possible impact, particularly on the children involved. At the very least, he suggested, it might figure out what actual problem it was trying to solve.\nThe government, in short, had only to show what it ought to be able to show with any legislation: that the good to be achieved outweighed the harm that might arise, in this case to the rights of a particularly vulnerable minority. Rather than take this elementary step, however, Premier Scott Moe chose to invoke the notwithstanding clause, overriding the Charter. That\u2019s why the legislature had to be recalled early.\nHaste upon haste upon haste, and all so that a handful of parents might find out something a little earlier than they would otherwise. It\u2019s preposterous.\nBut then, this isn\u2019t about the parents, or the children. It\u2019s about politics. It\u2019s about pandering to obscure fears and broader resentments \u2013 of teachers and bureaucrats and assorted other eggheads. And it\u2019s about picking a fight with the courts, to teach those uppity judges a thing or two in the bargain.\nIf it were just a matter of a particular bill in a particular province, that would be one thing. But this is the eighth attempt to use the clause, by four provinces, in the past five years, each of them every bit as ridiculous, and as appalling, as the last: from banning the wearing of religious symbols in the public sector (Quebec) to banning public sector unions from striking (Ontario) to banning English in the workplace (Quebec again).\nThis is the grubby reality of the notwithstanding clause. Its conservative advocates like to get all misty-eyed about parliamentary supremacy \u2013 as if the Charter itself were not an act of Parliament \u2013 or raise the spectre of some crazed, rogue court abolishing the Criminal Code or whatnot.\nBut wherever and whenever the clause is actually used, we see what it is really about: raw power, arbitrary and unjustified, usually for the purpose of beating up on unpopular minorities.\nJust as previous uses of the clause have emboldened Saskatchewan\u2019s government, so this latest assault on the Charter will embolden others: a kind of social contagion. But then, that is in the nature of the clause. Its very existence is a standing invitation to its use.\nYes, I see you there, with your hand up. Yes, I\u2019m aware the notwithstanding clause is part of the Charter. But it is nonsense to pretend this was what the people who drafted and passed it had in mind in 1982. They thought, and said, it would be invoked only in the most exceptional circumstances. That might have been tolerable in principle, even if it was never likely to be observed in practice. But a Charter that is routinely overridden is not a Charter at all.\nThis is of more than legalistic interest. The Charter was an essential part of the 1982 constitutional bargain, the sole counterweight to its broadly decentralizing thrust. If the Charter is no longer to have any practical effect, one of the few remaining ties binding the federation is gone.\nAnd there is another, even older bargain at stake. The clear understanding at Confederation was that rights would be protected by the federal government. Over time, this gave way to the courts. But if the courts are no longer permitted to do so, that leaves rights, for the first time in our history, with no protection at all. This is more than an affront to liberty: it is an abdication of nationhood, one that no federal government should tolerate.\nDoes the current crew in Ottawa understand this? Does anyone?", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-if-its-easy-to-override-the-charter-then-whats-protecting-canadians/", "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/Ciz7IP67ExeA76fJ6zOlpa2bLmM=/1200x799/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tgam/4XTDQLUIMVN4XIIBAGQKCY3HE4.JPG", "publishedAt": "2023-10-10T21:08:04Z", "source": {"name": "The Globe and Mail", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com"}}, {"title": "Students speak out about controversial AP African American Studies course: \"History that everybody should know\"", "description": "The AP African American Studies course has drawn fire from some Republicans calling it an example of \"woke-ism\" infiltrating education. But students in the course say it shouldn't be considered controversial.", "content": "Students say AP African American Studies course is \"history everybody should know\"\nThe questions started as soon as the last students trickled into Donald Singleton's first period Advanced Placement African American Studies class on a recent morning. For nearly two hours, Singleton, who has taught at Susan Miller Dorsey Senior High School in Los Angeles for 26 years, challenged his students on their own perceptions of history.\n\"What have you learned?\" he asked the class. \"What do you know about the role of African women during slavery?\"\n\"It was entirely permissible to rape a slave, kill a slave, hang a slave, lynch a slave,\" responded senior Hassan Wright. \"But if you taught them to read, you were just as bad as a slave.\"\nAdvanced Placement African American Studies is, at its core, a history course, tracing the Black experience from early African kingdoms to slavery and the civil rights movement through today. And while it's drawn fire from some Republicans calling it an example of \"woke-ism\" infiltrating education, students in the course say it shouldn't be considered controversial.\n\"This isn't a political class. This isn't like choosing sides. It's history that everybody should know,\" junior Rosselyn Reyes told CBS News.\nJordan Love, also a junior, said the class changed the way he thought about Black history.\n\"There's a major difference between having somebody tell you that you're the ancestor of a slave family and having somebody tell you that you're the ancestry of an advanced civilization,\" he said.\nSenior Kessiah Bing said she decided to take the class \"to learn more about my people, my history,\" adding, \"It's the truth.\"\nFacing pushback\nLike all other AP classes, African American Studies is designed by the non-profit College Board with help from university professors and offers students the opportunity to earn college credit. The class began taking shape in 2020 after the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police sparked nationwide protests. The College Board plans to make it available to any U.S. high school that wants it next year. Currently, more than 700 U.S. high schools are piloting the course \u2014 amid pushback from Republican leaders.\nIn January, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, called the class \"indoctrination\" and the state banned it outright. The state's education department wrote it was \"inexplicably contrary to Florida law and significantly lacks educational value.\"\nIn August, Arkansas said the course will no longer count toward graduation credit, writing in a letter to state superintendents \"the pilot may not comply with Arkansas law.\"\nRepublican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Fox News, \"we cannot perpetuate a lie to our students and propaganda leftist agenda teaching our kids to hate America and hate one another.\"\nWright, the senior at Dorsey, rejected claims the class stoked racial division.\n\"If there was a class that was deliberately telling students to hate White people and hate this country, I would be against that class, too,\" Wright said. \"I don't think we should teach hatred of any kind.\"\n\"My students come in excited\"\nAt Dorsey High School, where the student body is mostly Black and Latino, the hope is the class will entice a demographic that hasn't sought out AP classes at the same rate as others.\n\"The excitement for me is starting in Africa, and for millions and millions of Black kids, Africa is born in them,\" Singleton said. \"My students come in excited. They've done the reading. And they wonder, 'Wow, I never learned this in any of my other classes.'\"\nSingleton denies that the course indoctrinates his students.\n\"I inculcate my kids with the idea that you're just as beautiful, just as brilliant, as anyone else,\" he said. \"That's my job every day.\"\nHe embraced the idea that he was empowering his students, and drew parallels to teaching bedrock American texts.\n\"If it's not about empowerment, why do you say the Pledge of Allegiance? Why do we teach about the Declaration of Independence? Why do we teach about the Constitution? Isn't that empowerment?\" Singleton said.\nClaims of \"sanitizing\" history amid pressure\nThe course curriculum risks running afoul of measures that recently passed in 18 states restricting how K-12 instructors can teach about race.\nIn a statement to CBS News, Florida's Department of Education noted the state has standards for teaching Black history, which were adopted by the state legislature in July. The department says they comply with state law. The standards have been criticized as an effort to \"rewrite\" or \"omit\" parts of the Black experience, by including, among other things, instruction on \"how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\"\nNot long after Florida banned the class in January, the College Board amended the curriculum, removing content on systemic racism, the Black Lives Matter movement and the push for reparations.\nWhile the College Board said the changes were part of their \"regular development process,\" some educators said the organization acquiesced to political pressure.\nLos Angeles Unified School District superintendent Alberto Carvalho said he believes the College Board sanitized the curriculum.\n\"If you want to really learn about the history of the African American experience, you cannot leave out or sanitize slavery or the civil rights movements, or the fact that our nation has criminalized activities resulting in disproportionate numbers of people of color being imprisoned,\" Carvalho said.\nA spokesman for the College Board denied caving to political pressure and said some of the topics it removed may still be restored when the final curriculum is released later this year. The College Board also said \"in some states teachers have more room to maneuver than others\" and that it has \"given teachers the flexibility to teach the essential content without putting their livelihoods at risk.\"\n\"College Board's goal for all Advanced Placement courses is access \u2014 both access to challenging college-level course work, and access for as many of those students in as many states as possible,\" a College Board spokesman told CBS News. \"In some cases, those dual access goals come into conflict. Our commitment ultimately is to rigorous coursework that reflects the discipline and what students will encounter in a college classroom.\"\nSingleton said the curriculum is intended to be a roadmap and teachers are free to introduce additional topics, like the Black Lives Matter movement or reparations in California.\n\"Just because it's not gonna be tested on the exam, there's nothing that says you're not allowed to teach about these subjects,\" he said.\nCarvalho, who frequently sparred with DeSantis as the head of Miami's school district until 2021, also criticized Florida's new Black history standards, calling them an attempt to \"erase history.\"\n\"I've been an educator for 32 years. Never have I seen education becoming so polarized, so influenced by politics,\" he said.", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ap-african-american-studies-course-students-speak-out-history-that-everybody-should-know/", "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/10/10/e29827a6-f621-4078-a641-cc900406b0bf/thumbnail/1200x630g2/a66c3bfe0b92f9f1ebb8fa43f639d204/1010-cmo-apafricanamerican-ling.jpg?v=69042d5753ca4b526d6a54f60ee177ca", "publishedAt": "2023-10-10T11:40:00Z", "source": {"name": "CBS News", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com"}}, {"title": "Navratri 2023: Gujarat, Tamil Nadu to West Bengal, a Look at Navratri Traditions Across India", "description": "Navratri 2023: In North India, Navratri is celebrated as the victory of Lord Rama over the evil king Ravana while in Western India, it is celebrated with the famous Garba and Dandiya-Raas dance.

The former heavyweight champion captivated the general public at large with not just his impeccable skills but also his life outside the ring. \u2018The Greatest,\u2019 stood for many noble causes and had a purpose to his life. His life story and legacy inspired many around the globe\u2014 including Bernard Hopkins. The 58-year-old had a celebrated career of 55 victories with only eight defeats.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nMoreover, he retired in the year 2016 but continues to be a part of the sport as an analyst. In a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast, Hopkins got candid about his life and finding a purpose similar to the Great Muhammad Ali. So without further ado, let\u2019s dive in on his comments.\nBearnard Hopkins reflects on finding his purpose\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nMany know Hopkins as a legendary boxer. However, there is a lesser-known side to him. As a teenager, he was involved in petty street crimes. Inevitably, he was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to prison. Moreover, he knew his life had a purpose and found a boxing gym in his prison. Training for the sweet science ignited a vehement passion for what he needed in life at the time. Thereafter, as and when he was released from prison, Hopkins decided to make a career in the sport and ended up becoming a champion in multiple weight classes.\nWhile comparing himself to Ali\u2019s spirit, he stated, \u201cMy whole things is like, not preach, as I am accused of a couple of times, it is just in me, the spirit is in me. Muhammad Ali\u2019s spirit in me. I know I am here for a purpose. I have took that road, I have came through the road, there were days in my life that I had to do, I had to be there, needed to do that. Cause that was that mindset.\u201d\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nHe adds, \u201cOnce I understood my value, boy you can appreciate this, at 17, when I got certified, 5 out of fifteen, it leads to a bad time, the walk-off crew, they had a boxing gym there, and all of the Pennsylvania prisons which is 30, had boxing. It was part of baseball and football, that sparked. The flame came back.\u201d\nIt would be hard to deny that the former multi-weight champion lived quite a troubled life. However, he intrinsically knew his purpose, just like Ali did, and went on to achieve amazing feats in the sport. Moreover, we are curious to know, has he been a source of inspiration for you?

Just as Qantas had bought off most Canberra politicians with membership of its Chairman's Lounge, it had almost the entire Australian press in its pocket, flying reporters around the globe on junkets \u2014 with a select few flying gratis on holidays or with generous upgrades.\nWhen too much is barely enough\nDespite the airline's poor financial performance even before the pandemic hit, Joyce managed to secure himself eye-watering salaries.\nDuring his 15-year reign, he earned somewhere north of $125 million.\nThat's where board responsibility kicks in. Richard Goyder, as Qantas chairman, would be on first-name terms with every politician in the land (especially if they are members of the Chairman's Lounge).\nPoliticians, of course, are subject to the Westminster system of parliamentary responsibility, which dictates that you assume the blame for anything that goes wrong, whether you are at fault or not.\nBy refusing to accept responsibility, and having been awarded a significant pay lift himself, he's guaranteed a fiery reception at next month's annual general meeting.\nLoading...\nAgain, that is not a situation unique to Qantas. Despite the incredible array of underpayment scandals, our business leaders have spent the past 18 months desperately trying to thwart pay rises for their workers battling soaring costs of living and mortgage bills.\nThey've been incredibly successful. Annual wage rises have been well below 4 per cent, significantly less than inflation.\nThe justification is that productivity growth has stalled. That is true. One of the major factors for low productivity, however, is that business investment across the developed world has stagnated. That's a decision made by chief executives.\nNevertheless, it hasn't slowed the growth of executive salaries. According to one study, Australian chief executive salaries this year have risen 15 per cent, well above the rate of inflation.\nAt least the Qantas flame-out is keeping everyone else off the front page.", "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-10/ian-verrender-analysis-qantas-alan-joyce-broader-wage-theft/102953894", "image": "https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c53685c5a1835f2f007b3be941ac43cd?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=477&width=862&height=485", "publishedAt": "2023-10-09T17:51:01Z", "source": {"name": "ABC News", "url": "https://www.abc.net.au"}}, {"title": "Trump questions how Jews or \u2018anybody who loves Israel\u2019 can vote for Democrats", "description": "Former President Trump on Monday questioned Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats and hammered President Biden\u2019s foreign policy amid unfolding violence in Israel.

The State Department confirmed at least nine Americans were among those killed.\n\u201cLess than four years ago, we had peace in the Middle East with the historic Abraham Accords. Today we have all-out war in Israel, and it\u2019s going to spread very quickly\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat a difference a president makes.\u201d\nThe former president said that upon retaking office, he would cut off any money going to Palestinians and would reimpose and expand a travel ban that targeted several majority-Muslim countries.\nTrump has repeatedly positioned himself as deeply supportive of Israel, citing his recognition of the Golan Heights territory, his relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem and his administration\u2019s signing of the Abraham Accords to normalize relations among countries in the Middle East.\nBut he has also drawn backlash for frequently suggesting Jews who do not support him politically or who are not supportive of Israel are disloyal.\nTrump in September shared an image on social media telling \u201cliberal Jews\u201d to \u201cmake better choices\u201d amid celebrations of the Jewish New Year.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday declared Israel was \u201cat war\u201d with Hamas, a designated terrorist organization and militant group that controls Gaza, after it launched a barrage of rockets and invaded Israeli towns.\nBiden has vowed the U.S. will stand with Israel, describing the alliance as \u201crock solid and unwavering.\u201d The Biden administration has already repositioned military assets in the region and begun sending munitions and other resources to Israel as it seeks assistance from the U.S.\nTrump and 2024 presidential candidates have pointed to the unfreezing of $6 billion in Iranian oil funds as part of a deal with Iran completed last month to release five Americans who had been detained.\nBiden administration officials have pushed back strongly against any suggestion the $6 billion in funds were somehow connected to Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel. They noted the money did not come from U.S. taxpayers and was instead Iranian funds that had been unfrozen. They cited restrictions that the money could only be used for humanitarian purposes and highlighted that none of the money has been spent.\nTrump, who is comfortably leading his rivals in GOP primary polls at the state and national level, also pointed to the war in Ukraine and the chaotic U.S. withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as other instances of Biden\u2019s foreign policy leading to instability globally.\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m in the White House, the entire world will know that America is strong, America is safe, and that we are going to take care of our people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will take care of the men and women of our country, we\u2019re not going to worry about the rest of the world. We\u2019ll do that where necessary.\u201d\nTrump has expressed skepticism about providing aid to Ukraine, which the Biden administration has steadfastly supported. The former president has claimed he would bring the Ukraine-Russia conflict to an end within hours of taking office, though he has not provided any specifics about how he would do so.\nOn Afghanistan, Biden administration officials have argued they were boxed in strategically by the Trump administration\u2019s agreement with the Taliban and a drawdown of troops before leaving office.\n\u201cWith each and every lie, Donald Trump further proves he is too dangerous to lead the United States on the world stage,\u201d Sen.

A framed photo of Josip Broz Tito, former president of Yugoslavia, watches over a sprawling mural commemorating ITAS\u2019s unique victory in 2005: facing a government plan for privatisation, the employees successfully occupied the factory and won a court case to continue running the plant as a worker-owned enterprise.\nBeginning in 2015 and shot over the course of five years, Srdjan Kova\u010devi\u0107\u2019s rigorous, riveting documentary observes the troubled waters that follow this triumph. Having led the 2005 mutiny, Dragutin Varga is now the head of the factory\u2019s union, and his steadfast idealism over ITAS\u2019s future represents the generational divide among the workers. Dissatisfied with continuous delays in salary payments, the younger workmen are doubtful of the plant\u2019s current organisational structure.

Hundreds of innocent Israelis have been murdered, thousands injured, and an untold number kidnapped and taken hostage. Perhaps not so ironically, Friday also marked the 50th anniversary of the criminal aggression against Israel on Yom Kippur, the holiest day on the Jewish calendar.\nSocial media is awash with barbaric scenes: the corpse of a young Israeli woman being desecrated and paraded through the streets of Gaza; the intentional bombing of ambulances; the cold-blooded slaughter of innocent Israeli men, women, children and elderly alike; the anguished cries of family members searching for their loved ones.\nThe forerunner of what was to come were the sirens that went off early Saturday morning, heralding thousands of indiscriminate rocket attacks targeting Israeli civilians, which foreshadowed the terrorist acts to follow.\nThese heinous attacks are the latest example of Hamas\u2019s flagrant and persistent violations of international law, which have continued unabated over the entirety of their repressive rule. They are representative of a cluster of six war crimes that Hamas systematically commits.\nFirst, the deliberate targeting of civilians \u2013 including indiscriminate rocket attacks \u2013 is in and of itself a war crime, as Palestinian Authority officials have themselves acknowledged.\nSecond, Hamas consistently launches these attacks from within civilian areas and civilian structures, such as apartment buildings, mosques, schools and hospitals. This too is a war crime, and under international law, Hamas bears legal responsibility for any resulting harm to those civilians.\nThird, the misuse and abuse of humanitarian symbols for purposes of launching attacks is a war crime, called the perfidy principle. Examples include using an ambulance to transport fighters or weapons, or combatants disguising themselves as doctors in a hospital.\nThe fourth crime stems from the Genocide Conventions, which prohibits direct and public incitement to genocide. Hamas leaders\u2019 incendiary incitement is what set the stage for these gruesome attacks.\nFifth, the recruitment of children into armed conflict is a war crime, and a core Hamas tactic \u2013 it goes hand in hand with their incitement and indoctrination tactics.\nSixth, and finally, when attacks on civilians are systematic and widespread as a matter of state policy \u2013 as this latest assault so clearly was \u2013 they are not only war crimes, but crimes against humanity.\nThis most recent aggression, constituting both war crimes and crimes against humanity, has shocked the global conscience. It has unmasked and exposed the racist and terrorist nature of Hamas. For too long, the international community has remained willfully blind to the true nature of this regime.\nPalestinian civilians are also victims of Hamas. They suffer daily under its repressive, authoritarian regime. Money intended for humanitarian aid \u2013 for building schools, hospitals, and other vital infrastructure \u2013 is instead used for the rockets, tunnels and other weapons that Hamas uses to perpetrate its terrorist aggression. It is important to remember that the Hamas regime, and its genocidal antisemitic agenda, is not representative of the Palestinian people.\nWhen politicians describe Hamas members as their \u201cfriends,\u201d or provide exculpatory defences for their criminality, they become enablers and accomplices. When Western academics and journalists describe Hamas terrorists as freedom fighters, this is what they are supporting. When democratic governments turn a blind eye to the Iranian regime\u2019s widespread sponsorship of Hamas and other terror groups, this is what they are condoning.\nJustice and accountability for Hamas\u2019s continuing heinous aggression, as well as for all those who continue to aid and abet it, is long overdue.", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-heinous-attack-on-israel-is-yet-another-war-crime-perpetuated-by/", "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/vbtf6EgiifftguKaI0E0i-jMSEw=/1200x800/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tgam/FTPL3SPH5NLPTFEMJ7IAWLBP2E.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-10-07T21:52:33Z", "source": {"name": "The Globe and Mail", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com"}}, {"title": "This IAS Officer Failed Thrice In UPSC Exam But Did Not Give Up", "description": "IAS officer Chandrakant Bagoria serves as an example of never backing down from setbacks.", "content": "Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) exams are renowned for their difficulty, with aspirants aiming to become Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers.

Will it matter?", "description": "The move was the latest example of Trump attempting to flex his influence within a Republican Party he has already fundamentally reshaped in the eight years since his first White House bid", "content": "Open this photo in gallery: Former President Donald Trump welcomes Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, to the stage at a campaign rally in support of the campaign of Ohio Senate candidate JD Vance at Wright Bros. Aero Inc. at Dayton International Airport on Nov. 7, 2022, in Vandalia, Ohio.Michael Conroy/The Associated Press\nDonald Trump is again testing the power of his endorsement.\nWith an early morning social media post on Friday, Trump inserted himself into the chaotic race to replace Kevin McCarthy as House speaker by backing Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan for the post. The move was the latest example of Trump attempting to flex his influence within a Republican Party he has already fundamentally reshaped in the eight years since his first White House bid.\n\u201cI think he does well. I hope he does well,\u201d Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 GOP nomination, said of Jordan in a Friday interview with Real America\u2019s Voice. \u201cHe\u2019s got competition, as you understand. And they\u2019re friendly with me, too. Very nice people and good people. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\nWith Trump\u2019s firm grip on the GOP base, his endorsement can effectively clear the field in many congressional primaries. But the speaker\u2019s race is more complex, an intraparty fight that will play out in secret at points and in a tense environment with many Republicans furious about McCarthy\u2019s ouster. Jordan is facing at least one other candidate \u2013 House Majority Leader Steve Scalise \u2013 who is also on good terms with Trump. It\u2019s unclear whether anyone has enough votes to win the gavel and if Jordan were to lose, another Trump ally could emerge.\nTaken together, the dynamics mean that Trump\u2019s backing of Jordan may do little to sway the results. And that may not ultimately matter much.\nRegardless of who becomes the next speaker, Trump has undeniable sway over House Republicans. It was his supporters \u2013 led by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz \u2013 who orchestrated McCarthy\u2019s ouster and who have driven much of the House GOP\u2019s agenda. They have been unable or unwilling to pull themselves from his grip and now find themselves heading toward another presidential election with him at the top of the ticket, even as many in the party worry about his electability in November and his potential impact on down-ballot races.\nBut other factors are at play in the complicated deliberations. Speaker\u2019s elections are contests that can turn on personal relationships and deals between lawmakers that fall outside ideological lines.\nIt also remains unclear how much political capital Trump intends to use whipping votes on Jordan\u2019s behalf. While Trump was poised to support Jordan, he was angry that Texas Rep. Troy Nehls broke the news before he was ready, according to two Republicans familiar with his thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nA Trump spokesman did not respond to requests for comment Friday.\nTrump\u2019s 11th-hour interventions helped McCarthy win the speakership after 15 rounds of voting back in January, but the holdouts in that case were Trump allies. This time most hard line conservatives were already lining up behind Jordan.\nInstead, Jordan has been courting Republican moderates, trying to convince them that they will be heard if he is elected, despite his reputation as a hard-liner. Trump\u2019s endorsement ties Jordan even closer to the former president, potentially making it more difficult for moderate members to support him.\nFor his part, Jordan said the endorsement would aid his bid for the gavel.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the leader of our party, and I think he\u2019s going to be the next president,\u201d Jordan told reporters Friday at the Capitol.\nBeyond the immediate dynamics on Capitol Hill, Trump\u2019s involvement in the speaker\u2019s race speaks to his outsized role in the party. More than three months before the first votes of the 2024 campaign, Republicans are increasingly open in referring to Trump as the party\u2019s leader. That\u2019s despite the fact that he faces four separate criminal indictments.\nAnd as he appears once again in a strong position to capture the GOP nomination, Trump\u2019s penchant for the spotlight is on display.\nAfter creating a media firestorm Monday when he showed up at his civil fraud trial in New York, Trump quickly jumped on the speakership news that threatened to shift attention from his direction. After several of his closest allies raised the fanciful notion that Trump himself could potentially serve as speaker \u2013 perhaps on an interim basis \u2013 Trump stoked and flirted with the notion of swooping in to save the leaderless caucus from the chaos he has helped to stoke.\n\u201cA lot of people have been calling me about speaker. All I can say is we\u2019ll do whatever\u2019s best for the country and for the Republican Party,\u201d Trump told reporters at the courthouse Wednesday.\nHe later told Fox News Digital that he would be open to serving 30 to 90 days in the role.\nTrump was soon planning a trip to Capitol Hill where he planned to address Republicans at a closed-door candidate forum \u2013 a trip first reported by The Messenger \u2013 that would have marked his first visit to the building since the violence of Jan. 6, when a mob of his supporters stormed the building trying to overturn the election he lost to President Joe Biden.\nThat trip is no longer expected, according to Nehls and others familiar with the plans.\nJordan has long been one of Trump\u2019s biggest champions on the Hill. He has led investigations into prosecutors who have charged the former president with criminal conduct and has been helping lead efforts to impeach Biden.\nAhead of Jan. 6, he helped Trump strategize about how Congress could help Trump overturn his loss to Biden. In return, Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2013 the nation\u2019s highest civilian honour \u2013 five days after the attack on the Capitol.\nScalise, a veteran member of leadership who is also vying for the speaker\u2019s gavel, has support from a significant portion of the Republican Conference, while other GOP lawmakers are either looking elsewhere or waiting to make their choices known.\nTrump\u2019s involvement in the House GOP\u2019s upheaval comes just as Republican leaders have been trying to tamp down the drama and soothe tempers. On Friday, a planned Fox News debate between the candidates was called off. Republicans are also trying to avoid the spectacle of a protracted speaker\u2019s contest by finding a consensus candidate in closed-door meetings next week.\nHowever, many are bracing for a days-long contest. The last time they all gathered in the same room \u2013 shortly after McCarthy was removed as speaker \u2013 insults were hurled and some lawmakers even thought it could turn to blows.\nSo far, the contest for the speaker\u2019s gavel has been dominated by lawmakers seen as loyal to Trump. Jordan, Scalise and Rep.

Armstrong is one of the few of a team which played under no less than three separate first-team managers; Ralph Hassenhuttl, Nathan Jones and Ruben Selles.\nPerhaps it should come as no surprise given those tumultuous conditions that the Saints slipped through the top-flight trapdoor and back into the second-tier for the first time since 2005.\nArmstrong has emerged as one of the leading figures in a new-look team. He has even inherited the armband in recent weeks in the absence of club captain Jack Stephens. And while he wasn't necessarily expecting to become one of the figureheads of Martin's new team, he is relishing his new responsibilities.\nSpeaking exclusively to Mirror Football , Armstrong says: \"I've played a lot of games now - I think over 300 - so I'll bring my experience of this league and what I know and help the young lads when they need it. It's a case of getting used to it, being a leader, but it's something I'm enjoying at the minute.\n\"It's something I've always wanted to do it [captain the side]. I was captain for a little bit at Blackburn when we had injuries. It's an honour to have the armband. I'm not one to scream at players in the changing room, it's more about encouragement on the pitch and leading by example. It's something that's gone well.\n\"It was something that just came about. I wasn't really thinking about that. I was primarily focused on getting my head down and trying to get going straight away. The gaffer has put his trust in me and I'd like to think I'm repaying that out on the pitch.\"\nThe sweeping changes that have been implemented across the south coast since Martin's arrival have been seismic. He quickly emerged as the club's primary target to replace Selles and, eventually, a deal was struck with Swansea City for him to take charge.\nThe early weeks of his tenure have not been without their teething problems, though; a run of four successive losses had seen the Saints not only slip as low as 15th in the table, but also a barrage of criticism levelled at him.\n(Image: Matt Watson/Southampton FC)\nThe 37-year-old's possession-heavy ideology has, perhaps, not translated as fluently in terms of results as some in the St Marys' hierarchy would have hoped. Only Blackburn and strugglers Rotherham (21) have shipped more than the 20 goals Southampton have conceded already this term, with a porous defence likely to have major ramifications on their hopes of an instant return to the top-flight.\nBut the Saints are now outside the play-offs on goal difference alone following back-to-back wins against Leeds and Stoke. A nine-point week would make the Championship standings look far more favourable with the frenetic festive period looming on the horizon.\nArmstrong, though, has no major concerns. As a seasoned Championship operator, he knows the peaks and troughs that a season in the second-tier inevitably brings - and he is also under no illusions about the positive impact Martin has had on the Saints.\n\"It's been spot on [since Martin came in]. I can only speak for myself, but training has been intense and the way he wants to play is obviously different to the last manager we had. Even for me, being here and at other teams, it's different to them as well, but it's something that I'm loving.\n\"I've been in the Championship previously and I know what it's about; it's a very tough league. We went four games without a win and now we've bounced back, that's exactly what this division is all about. No doubt a lot of teams will go through that this season.\n\"In any workplace, when there's change, it's always going to take a bit of time to nail it down. It's something that we're still trying to do.\n\"Playing this way isn't something that the lads have been used to in recent years, but we've hit the ground running and we're enjoying it. Change is always going to be hard, but I think we're on the other side now and we can kick on.\"\nIn Armstrong, they have the most valuable of commodities: a proven Championship goalscorer. Only five players can better the tally of 28 goals he plundered for Blackburn Rovers in this division back in the 2020/21 campaign.\nHe was unable to replicate those figures in the top-flight, where he scored twice in 14 starts last year. But Armstrong currently finds himself back in familiar settings at the pinnacle of the Championship goalscoring charts after plundering seven goals in 10 games.\n(Image: Matt Watson/Southampton FC)\nMartin himself believes Armstrong is, perhaps, better suited to his current style rather than the intense pressing principles that were previously instilled by Hassenhuttl. Armstrong's versatility has already proved invaluable; he has played as a striker, a winger and No.9 already this term.\n\"I've been in other teams and done well with different styles. I would like to think this one does suit me a bit more [though]. I'm creating chances and getting chances.\n\"It's one of those things: chances come and go, but in this team at the moment we're creating a lot and it's about putting them away. That's something I've done in the first 10 games and it's going well.\n\"He's given me that confidence to go out there and play my normal game. I've been in the normal position I like to play [in] and things have just worked.\n\"It's a reset every year, no matter how well you do. I scored 28 goals at Blackburn, the season before that I scored 16; I'd still had an unbelievable season, but I still had to reset and go again.\n(Image: PA)\n\"It isn't about having a bad season or whatever, my mindset - and I think a lot of the lads, too - is to reset every season anyway. You don't want to dwell on the past.\"\nThat last statement rings true; nobody at Southampton has any desire to relive or replicate a campaign brimming with disappointment and despair. An instant return to the Premier League would, naturally, be the perfect tonic to banish those memories once and for all for players like Armstrong, who endured the bitter sting of relegation for the first time.\n\"That's obviously the plan, getting back to the Premier League. That's every kid's dream. It's something the majority of us have done before and we need to get promoted again - it's as simple as that.\n\"There's a lot of games left to play, so we can't be thinking about it at the minute. We need to keep on working on ourselves and take it game-by-game. It's so cliche, but it's so true.\"\nJoin our new WhatsApp community!

Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA Wire\nWe talk a lot about urban dereliction. We don\u2019t talk nearly enough about natural dereliction, the slow sacrifice of the countryside to powerful agricultural and industrial interests and public apathy.\nThe plight of Lough Neagh is a rare exception that cut through to garner some national interest \u2013 even if the sudden blossoming of public interest in its fate came almost a decade after the toxic algae began to bloom.\nCaused by agricultural run-off, sewage and rising temperatures, the algal bloom has turned the largest freshwater lake in the UK and Ireland an alarming shade of Ghostbusters green. It has killed off some wildlife and reportedly some pets, and is threatening the lake\u2019s eel fishing industry. Oh, and the lake is responsible for 40 per cent of the North\u2019s water supply.\nThe state of the lough seemed to capture wider public attention because it struck many observers as a beautifully apt metaphor for the toxic state of politics in the North, or the attitude of \u201cout of sight and out of mind\u201d that seems to determine Britain\u2019s approach to Northern Ireland. As Newton Emerson pointed out here recently, it\u2019s a good metaphor, but not an accurate one. Lough Neagh\u2019s plight predates the current stasis in the North; it is an ecological collapse that has been at least a decade in the making.\nREAD MORE\nThe toxic algae began to take hold during the brief golden age of Stormont, when an ambitious plan was formulated to give a boost to agri-business in the North. Even if what is euphemistically referred to as \u201cthe nutrients\u201d causing the bloom were immediately reduced it would still take 21 years for the water quality to return to \u201cgood\u201d status.\nBut while the dead lough is not really an accurate analogy for the political deadlock, it is a useful metaphor for the way the natural world is treated as a commercial asset.\nThe land surrounding the lough is the property of the Earl of Shaftesbury, Nicholas Ashley-Cooper, a resident of Dorset, England, whose family was \u201cgifted\u201d it in the 17th century, lucky things. The Shaftesbury estate sells licences to companies that want to extract sand from the lake. Eight years ago the Belfast Telegraph reported that its duck population had been reduced by 75 per cent as a result of the extraction and pollution.\nAshley-Cooper told the BBC this week that he \u201calways gets blamed for things that are completely outside of my control\u201d. He only owns the \u201cbed and soil\u201d; the water is \u201cnot our responsibility\u201d. He would, he said, like to \u201cdo the right thing by the people living here\u201d. But he won\u2019t just be handing it over: \u201cI\u2019d like to be treated as any other business owner and the business has a value.\u201d\nThis display of unabashed commercialism led to outrage online, including claims that Lough Neagh is a vital natural resource that \u201cbelongs to all of us\u201d. Really, a thousands-of-years-old lake doesn\u2019t belong to any of us; we\u2019re just its custodians. But he isn\u2019t the only one guilty of looking on a natural resource as an asset.\nTake the current debate over the nitrates directive. Farmers have been campaigning against the EU moves to end the derogation which allows them spread higher levels of fertiliser on land. They are perfectly within their rights to defend their income. But it\u2019s worth remembering that what they are also fighting for is their right to keep polluting our lakes and waterways.\nIn all half of our rivers and lakes and two-thirds of our estuaries are polluted, and the annual reports from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are taking on an increasingly anxious tone. The latest EPA data, published over the summer, found levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in Irish watercourses were unacceptably high. The cause is human activities such as farming and forestry.\nBarely a month goes by without some stomach-churning incident involving our waterways. In June Uisce \u00c9ireann shut off a pipe which was discharging sewage from an unauthorised wastewater plant into the Nenagh river. In August a 1km stretch of the Glashaboy River in Cork turned a bluish grey after a pollution incident.\nAnd in July, in the kind of irony so rich it\u2019s probably capable of growing its own algal bloom, Inland Fisheries Ireland secured a prosecution against Uisce \u00c9ireann for pollution of the River Liffey at a treatment plant in Ballymore Eustace, Co Kildare.\nThere\u2019s no room for smugness south of the border about the plight of Lough Neagh either. This week photos emerged of the same lurid green sludge curdling below the surface of the Blessington lakes, also known as Poulaphouca reservoir, also known as the source of the drinking water for 50 per cent of the greater Dublin area.\nDuring the summer Keeldra Lough in Leitrim was closed for 65 days between June and September because of toxic algae that have been blighting the lake for a number of years. In the past few years blooms have been detected in Lough Lein and other Killarney lakes, Cavan\u2019s Lough Sheelin, and several others.\nThis week the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council published its findings on the cost of assisting the agricultural transition, retrofitting and other supports at between \u20ac1.6 billion and \u20ac3 billion per year from 2026 to 2030, and up to \u20ac1.9 billion a year after that. In all, compensating farmers for changing their practices will account for a third of the overall cost we face for dealing with climate change. In the long term farmers will be okay.\nWe talk a lot about the scourge of urban dereliction. But the dereliction of the environment is a ticking time bomb.", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/2023/10/07/aristocrat-who-owns-lough-neagh-isnt-the-only-business-owner-when-it-comes-to-natural-resources/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/GDy7cNjb0jfCBAz36ewbL6lhixQ=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/GBU6MDAEZXYMUNVL7H26UTVVVQ.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-10-07T05:00:00Z", "source": {"name": "The Irish Times", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com"}}, {"title": "Claim DHL worker faced disciplinary hearing for sending self-harm images during mental health crisis", "description": "Nigel Kent was hauled in front of bosses after sending a self-harm image during a mental health crisis - he said it was an example of the supply chain giant punishing him for his illness rather than supporting him", "content": "A DHL employee is willing to be sacked for speaking out about his mental health struggles while working at the company.

All over the world big companies like this think they can treat you like a number and don't care.

Seeing every developer featured in panels, interviews, and talks being people of color (and nearly all queer people of color no less!) is something that\u2019s rarely seen in industry events, whether gaming or tech.\nThis is despite the fact that culture, ethnicity, race, and all lived experiences culminating from those other factors have a huge impact on how we perceive and experience games, as well as how we approach all aspects of gaming development. These factors cannot be separated, yet they are often seen as \u201cother\u201d and \u201cpolitical,\u201d to the point that those with the most privilege in the game industry willfully ignore them.\nThere\u2019s even a major trend that when media, including video games, features protagonists and casts that are not all white and majority male it\u2019s suddenly labeled as \u201cwoke\u201d and \u201cpolitical,\u201d with the former term being appropriated African American vernacular English (AAVE) that\u2019s been twisted to near slur levels. While the trend has only recently gained traction, it\u2019s been long codified by the gaming industry which has historically featured a stock white male \u201ceveryman\u201d hero across the majority of video games.\nThankfully, there have been significant efforts from People of Color (PoC) in the indie scene that have fought against these harmful narratives and beliefs. As such, there are many examples of games that benefit from having marginalized developers, allowing them to tell stories drawn from their own vital perspectives - many of which have been featured in GDoCExpo.\nSucker for Love: Date to Die For , is a great example of this, and follows on from the original Lovecraftian horror dating sim First Date. As outlined by creator Joseph \"Akabaka\" Hunter during my own interview with him , the intention was to make a protagonist that was both a woman of color and queer with mechanics and a plot designed around her identity. Hunter also intended to include other horror tropes and storytelling based on real-life experiences of Black people (i.e., Sundown Towns). This is especially significant considering the famously bigoted origins of Lovecraftian horror in the first place.\nAnother title featured in 2023\u2019s expo, Hill Agency: PURITYdecay , also enlightens us on how an Indigenous viewpoint can completely change how we see sci-fi settings. Instead of the very Western \u201cclean\u201d aesthetic that\u2019s become synonymous with the post-post-apocalyptical future, this game\u2019s world has nature completely intertwined with the architecture. Buildings have also been reappropriated and made more sustainable for families to live in, defying the Western capitalist notion of housing developed solely for profit.\n(Image credit: Achimostawinan Games)\nThere are plenty more, such as the recently released El Paso, Elsewhere by Xalavier Nelson, which tells of a Black vampire hunter and how he grapples with grief and trauma as he sets out on a mission to kill his ex: the Queen of all vampires. Nelson specifically delved into how Black men are forced to suppress certain emotions, especially those tied to grief and heartbreak, to better fit the mold of how they\u2019re seen in society.\nOn the softer and more grounded end of the spectrum are Venba and A Taste of the Past , two cooking games that celebrate Asian culture through their cuisine, though the latter also deals with grief and the trauma that comes from it. Thirsty Suitors is also generously infused with important cultural touchstones, all expressed through turn-based battles, skateboarding, and cooking.\nOn the flip side, we can also see recent examples of when games were made without input and creative direction from marginalized people. For instance, the now infamous discourse surrounding Square Enix\u2019s Final Fantasy 16 unfolded in two parts. The first was the intentional exclusion of Black people and other people of color from the game, despite how anti-historical that was. The second was the atrocious handling of slavery in the game, which has been extensively documented. But it can mainly be summarized as using the horrifying practice as mere storytelling window dressing with zero nuance and then discarding it for a \u201cfight god\u201d plotline near the end.\nAnother more general and pervasive issue is how Black hair \u2014 specifically 4c hair \u2014 is handled in gaming. For the most part, not well. But infamous examples include the lack of black hair options in character customization (barring the \u201cfunny\u201d oversized afro), Black hairstyles that don\u2019t accurately use the proper texture but instead are repurposed straight hair textures, not to mention the Sims 4 concept artist that used cauliflower as a reference for an afro hairstyle.\nAs with most other industries, the gaming industry has historically been intertwined with colonialistic tropes that present Whiteness and Westerness as the norm and ideal. And when racial, cultural, and ethnic aspects are reproduced without any input from those groups, it\u2019s instead often used as a window dressing with little in the way of depth or thought. This is where the concept of marginalized identities being seen as \u201cother,\u201d \u201cpolitical,\u201d and \u201cwoke\u201d originated from, and it\u2019s one that hamstrings the gaming industry to this day.\nThe reality is far richer. Looking at the indie scene, when PoC are at the forefront of gaming development and can express their own lived experiences, you have a product that\u2019s far more accurate and authentic to the lived experiences of a range of races, cultures, and ethnicities. It creates a richer and more diverse experience, one that not only speaks true to the developers themselves but to the audience as well.\nLooking for more great games to play?

Standing next to a guy whose face was completely obscured with a black ski mask, she threw up a peace sign and smiled. The ski-mask guy was wearing a T-shirt. \u201cI\u2019m just here for the riots,\u201d it read.\nThe next day, at work, Ms. Newton could hear her phone blowing up with notifications. That photo, taken downtown during the Stanley Cup riot, had gone viral. Online stones were being cast against Ms. Newton; she had no ability to explain or provide context.\nMs. Newton\u2019s cheerful photo was a wrong place/wrong time (and bad judgment) situation. She was nowhere near the destruction, she says in a new documentary, I\u2019m Just Here for the Riot, screening at the Vancouver International Film Festival. That didn\u2019t stop people from denouncing her.\nA Vancouverite, I remember that night very well \u2013 and what happened next. The following day, ordinary citizens came downtown to clean up. They swept up debris and wrote bathroom-graffiti-type love notes to Vancouver on boards covering vandalized windows. It was beautiful.\nThe other thing that happened made me feel less hopeful about humanity, though I know many would disagree. The virulent naming-and-shaming campaign to expose the rioters took on a life of its own, as photos circulated documenting that evening\u2019s ugliness.\nThen-Vancouver Police Department chief Jim Chu calls what happened \u201cthe world\u2019s first smartphone riot.\u201d Facebook users created public pages to identify the rioters. The VPD launched its own page. Charges were laid and cases prosecuted, which was good.\nAs for the public shaming that took place, however, no official or legal procedures were required in this early example of online mobbing.\n\u201cThere were two riots going on. There was the physical riot. And then there was the exact same thing on the internet,\u201d doc subject Sarah McCusker says.\nOpportunities were lost; lives were changed. Ms. McCusker, who had turned 21 the day before the riot, believes her experience of being named and shamed contributed to her developing a drug addiction.\nAlex Prochazka, then a professional mountain biker, posed for a photo in front of a burning car. Within days, he lost his sponsorships. Fair enough.\nBut a boy in the film identified as \u201cDylan\u201d \u2013 whose photo brandishing a hockey stick while standing in front of shattered bank windows went extremely viral \u2013 was doxxed and harassed with at times racist abuse. He was 17.\nMs. McCusker was also called names we can\u2019t publish. \u201cThe mobs on the internet,\u201d she says in the film, \u201cwere no better than the people in the riot.\u201d I\u2019m not so sure about that. Ms. McCusker had reached through the broken window of an H&M, pulling out some clothing. When she turned around and saw cameras pointed at her, she dropped it on a bench, she recounts.\nYou could say the violators deserve to be shamed. But in the name of fighting for what\u2019s right \u2013 a peaceful, civilized, orderly society where, for instance, a hockey game loss won\u2019t spark a riot \u2013 people, cloaked in decency-warrior personae, can become monsters themselves.\nSocial media has allowed for \u201ca great renaissance of public shaming,\u201d as Jon Ronson calls it in his 2015 bestseller So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed. What stupid things did you do as a 17-year-old that nobody caught on camera because we weren\u2019t all walking around with them 24/7 in our pockets? Granted, you probably didn\u2019t riot, break into stores, flip anyone\u2019s car or set it on fire. But you might have done things you are embarrassed about today \u2013 if you can remember them.\nWhy do some people take delight in online shaming?\nNow when still-maturing young people break the rules \u2013 or an adult behaves badly in the spur of the moment, perhaps driven by emotion on a bad day \u2013 it can be a life-changing event. The internet never forgets. A baseball fan throws a beer can in a moment of passion; a casual social-media user posts a bad tweet. Do they deserve to lose their jobs, or have their lives ruined \u2013 or, at least, irrevocably altered?\nIt depends on what it is they did or said, sure. But the aggressive meanness of the pile-on is disturbing. Mr. Prochazka calls it a \u201chate bandwagon.\u201d\nIn the film, Ms. McCusker says, \u201cthere are no consequences for the people on social media, for what they did.\u201d But I would argue that there are. The posters\u2019 names (if they use real names) and comments are also searchable: their racist, sexist, homophobic taunts, their death threats.\nWhat is it that people get out of shaming others? Is it a 15-minutes-of-fame thing? The need to be right?\nThe baseball playoffs are on, as is the NHL preseason. The culture wars are raging. People are struggling to pay their bills.

In the last century, while totalitarian states busied themselves trampling on human rights and freedoms, organizing an industry of death that produced the Holocaust and taking away the lives and wealth of millions of Europeans, the U.S. grew and thrived as a stable democracy and law-abiding government.\nThis is why Poles think it is vital for Americans to understand the issue of Germany paying compensation for damage caused during World War II. Responsibility for failing to resolve this issue, which still divides Poles and Germans, lies squarely with the German state.\nIn an attempt to systematically and deliberately eradicate the Polish and Jewish nations, Germany implemented an ideology of racial, national, and cultural supremacy that led to the Holocaust and the deaths of 5.2 million Polish citizens.\nDespite German policy designed to force Polish and Jewish neighbors to turn on each other, Polish and Jewish cooperation was common. Along with clear instances of hope and success\u2014reflected by the number of Poles honored by Yad Vashem\u2014there was also tragedy\u2014as seen with the Catholic Church's recent beatification of the Ulma family who were killed for refusing a German order to denounce the Jews they protected.\nIn 1939, Poland was the first to resist Adolf Hitler; the price Poles paid was horrendous. The dangers of resisting were clear, but defending their country drew Polish citizens together, including some 100,000 Polish soldiers of Jewish descent.\nPoland's industrial potential was crushed and Poland's population was decimated, with millions being used as slave labor for German firms and others for medical experiments. The Germans enacted a policy of destroying Polish elites, which was alarmingly successful. Poland's post-war population in 1945 was approximately 30 percent lower than it had been in 1939.\nAfter the war, Germany's GDP was higher than it had been in 1939. Poland's only recovered to 1939 levels in the late 1970s. It took almost as long for Poland's population to recover.\nA Polish flag is seen in front of the Westerplatte monument during a ceremony as part of the commemorations marking 80 years since the outbreak of World War II on September 1, 2019 in Gdansk, Poland. Simon Krawczyk / AFP/Getty Images\nHowever, despite Poland suffering the greatest human and material losses of all European countries during the war, it did not receive any reparations. Poland being placed into the Soviet sphere of influence after 1945 and then sidelined in 1990 despite gaining independence in 1989 meant that no treaty was ever signed with Germany and no payment for war damages was ever made.\nIn contrast, Germany paid reparations to all other World War II victim states after the Potsdam Conference in 1945. Poland's position is unique and the disparity between how Poland and other victim states were treated is startling.\nLast year, the Polish government, with public and cross-party support, revived the issue by formally asking the German government to enter talks on compensation for war losses. We act as the last representatives of the wartime generation who remember the terror of 1939-45.\nWe reminded Germany of a basic principle of the rule of law and of Western civilization, i.e. that victims must receive material and moral compensation as redress for harm and loss. Such compensation for evidence-backed crimes is not limited by time\u2014even after 78 years.\nAs a NATO member and EU superpower, Germany must set a global example. It would be morally questionable and an obvious contradiction for Germany to play the role of a guarantor of peace if it avoids liability for its World War II crimes, doesn't pay compensation to innocent victims\u2014hundreds of thousands of whom are still alive\u2014and refuses to talk to victim states. By talking to Poland, Germany will prove it isn't afraid of its obligations, is aware that it cannot apply double standards, and can take center stage as a leading state.\nI am optimistic that Poland and Germany will find a mutual solution, close a difficult historical chapter, and establish close future cooperation, but it will take time. What is indisputable, however, is that the first step toward finding reconciliation and moving forward is to talk. Without this step, it will be difficult for Poland to support Germany's nomination should it be proposed. Especially today, we must show that talking and reconciliation is fundamental to building future relationships. As long as Germany refuses to engage in talks with Poland, its candidacy for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council would be absurd.\nArkadiusz Mularczyk is Poland's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/unresolved-past-contradicts-germanys-potential-role-un-security-council-opinion-1832095", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2290493/poland-world-war-ii-memorial.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-10-05T10:30:01Z", "source": {"name": "Newsweek", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com"}}, {"title": "GM\u2019s Mary Barra is charging ahead on EVs and navigating the UAW auto strike.

For generations, business leaders had put their shareholders\u2019 interests first, but under stakeholder capitalism, those interests are only one priority among many: Employees, customers, and communities are given equal consideration.\nWhat came next was a kind of Era of Good Feeling: We saw a huge uptick in pledges from global companies to leap forward in diversity and equity, treat their employees better, and make a positive impact on the planet.\nA few years later, many of those commitments have been whiffed on, walked back, or deprioritized. Efficiency and cost savings are in, diversity and inclusion jobs are out, and net-zero timelines are being pushed back, as some companies are realizing how expensive\u2014and distracting\u2014it can feel to try to serve more than one constituency.\nBut stakeholder capitalism was never about making business less profitable, or putting morality over money. There are real proof points that for those with the patience and the willpower, it can be the most successful and lucrative strategy in the long term.\nTake a look at the auto industry, where the push into electric vehicles, a vital step in the fight against climate change, is paying off for those who remain committed. True, EVs currently make up only 7.2% of the U.S. market, but they\u2019re trending in the right direction. Tesla had one of the fastest journeys ever to the top 50 of the Fortune 500 (the largest U.S. companies by revenue). And General Motors, which has been in the top 50 for decades, shares the No. 1 spot on our annual Change the World list this year for its purpose-driven commitment to make only EVs by 2035.\nThis isn\u2019t always an easy path to walk. GM\u2019s commitments are being sorely tested, as consumer EV adoption has moved slower than hoped and the company tussles with the United Auto Workers over jobs and compensation in an electrified world.\nStill, the EV example also goes to show that what CEOs say ultimately matters far less than how they execute. You could hardly find two more different personalities than the volatile Elon Musk and GM\u2019s matter-of-fact Mary Barra. But each has found financial success by sticking to their mission.

This is one of the fundamental facts of chemistry.", "content": "Every element exhibits specific properties, usually determined by the number of electrons in its atoms and the distribution of these electrons around the nucleus. Also, every piece of a pure element exhibits exactly the same properties, regardless of its size. A piece of pure gold, for example, has properties very different from a piece of silver or any other element, but every piece of gold, whether it is a large 100-gram piece or a small 10 milligram one, has exactly the same properties. This is one of the fundamental facts of chemistry.\nBut about forty years ago, scientists started discovering something very remarkable. Very small particles, in the nanoscale range, were found to behave slightly differently from larger particles of the same element. A nanoparticle (sizes in the range of 1 to 100 billionth of a metre) of gold, for example, displayed properties different in some respects from larger particles of gold. Such deviant behaviour had been predicted in theory a few decades earlier, but never observed.\nAlexei Ekimov was the first to notice this deviant behaviour in Copper Chloride nanoparticles around 1980. He was also able to manufacture these nanoparticles to show this change in behaviour. However, as he was working in the erstwhile USSR then, his finding was largely unknown in the rest of the world.\nA few years later, Louis Brus, an American scientist working independently, discovered similar behaviour in Cadmium Sulphide nanoparticles. He too was able to create these nanoparticles with changed properties. Moungi Bawendi, who worked with Brus in the initial part of the career, later developed easier methods to efficiently produce nanoparticles that showed some desired deviant behaviour.\nFor their path-breaking research, done three to four decades ago, Ekimov (78), Brus (80), and Bawendi (62) were awarded the 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Thanks to their work, nanoparticles with desired deviant behaviour have become an integral part of a variety of modern appliances, including television, computer screens, and LED lamps. There are a wide range of applications in biochemistry and medicine as well.\nQuantum dots\nThe deviant behaviour of small nanoparticles arises because of the emergence of quantum effects. The motion and behaviour of very small particles, like electrons, are radically different, and strange, when compared with any familiar object in normal human experience. Such strange behaviour at the sub-atomic level is described by the hugely successful Quantum Theory, developed by physicists 100 years ago.\nBut nanoparticles are much larger compared with atoms. Depending on the size of the atom, a nanoparticle can pack in thousands to millions of atoms. However, it was theorised, in the 1930s itself, that when the size of particles was reduced to nanoscale, it could give rise to quantum effects.\nAdvertisement\nThis was mainly because electrons were constrained in a small space. Usually, electrons move around in a large empty space, relatively speaking, outside the nucleus of the atom. But when the size of the particles is reduced drastically, electrons in the atoms find themselves increasingly squeezed. And this, it was thought, could give rise to the strange quantum effects.\nThis is what Ekimov and Brus noticed, and this is what they were able to create in their laboratories \u2014 nano-sized particles that behaved slightly differently than larger particles of the same element. These nanoparticles with special properties were called quantum dots.\nThe discoveries\nOne of the most noticeable special properties of the nanoparticles becomes evident when they interact with light. The colour of any material depends on the wavelengths of the light spectrum absorbed or reflected by the material.\nAdvertisement\nEkimov was working with coloured glass tinted with Copper Chloride when he noticed something special. He heated molten glass to very high temperatures and then allowed it to cool and harden. Crystals of Copper Chloride, of different sizes, had formed on the glass. He observed that the part of the glass where smaller crystals of Copper Chloride were present had a slightly different colour than the area where there were larger crystals. What this showed was that the same material, Copper Chloride, was absorbing different wavelengths of light depending on its size.\nBrus also observed a similar phenomenon, while working on something completely different. He too realised that particles of different sizes, all in the nanometer range, were interacting with light in different ways. This meant that apart from the number of electrons, the properties of the material were also being dictated by its size.\nBoth Ekimov and Brus could fabricate these nanoparticles, but their methods required extreme conditions and produced particles of unpredictable quality.

George de Hevesy\u2019s research on radioactive tracers is one such example.", "content": "Each October, the Nobel Prizes celebrate a handful of groundbreaking scientific achievements. And while many of the awarded discoveries revolutionize the field of science, some originate in unconventional places. For George de Hevesy, the 1943 Nobel Laureate in chemistry who discovered radioactive tracers, that place was a boarding house cafeteria in Manchester, U.K., in 1911.\nDe Hevesey had the sneaking suspicion that the staff of the boarding house cafeteria where he ate at every day was reusing leftovers from the dinner plates \u2013 each day\u2019s soup seemed to contain all of the prior day\u2019s ingredients. So he came up with a plan to test his theory.\nAt the time, de Hevesy was working with radioactive material. He sprinkled a small amount of radioactive material in his leftover meat. A few days later, he took an electroscope with him to the kitchen and measured the radioactivity in the prepared food.\nHis landlady, who was to blame for the recycled food, exclaimed \u201cthis is magic\u201d when de Hevesy showed her his results, but really, it was just the first successful radioactive tracer experiment.\nWe are a team of chemists and physicists who work at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, located at Michigan State University. De Hevesy\u2019s early research in the field has revolutionized the way that modern scientists like us use radioactive material, and it has led to a variety of scientific and medical advances.\nThe nuisance of lead\nA year before conducting his recycled ingredients experiment, Hungary-born de Hevesy had traveled to the U.K. to start work with nuclear scientist Ernest Rutherford, who\u2019d won a Nobel Prize just two years prior.\nRutherford was at the time working with a radioactive substance called radium D, a valuable byproduct of radium because of its long half-life (22 years). However, Rutherford couldn\u2019t use his radium D sample, as it had large amounts of lead mixed in.\nWhen de Hevesy arrived, Rutherford asked him to separate the radium D from the nuisance lead. The nuisance lead was made up of a combination of stable isotopes of lead (Pb). Each isotope had the same number of protons (82 for lead), but a different number of neutrons.\nDe Hevesy worked on separating the radium D from the natural lead using chemical separation techniques for almost two years, with no success. The reason for his failure was that, unknown to anyone at the time, radium D was actually a different form of lead \u2013 namely the radioactive isotope, or radioisotope Pb-210.\nNevertheless, de Hevesy\u2019s failure led to an even bigger discovery. The creative scientist figured out that if he could not separate radium D from natural lead, he could use it as a tracer of lead.\nRadioactive isotopes, like Pb-210, are unstable isotopes, which means that over time they will transform into a different element. During this transformation, called radioactive decay, they typically release particles or light, which can be detected as radioactivity.\nThis radioactivity acts as a signature indicating the presence of the radioactive isotope. This critical property of radioisotopes allows them to be used as tracers.\nRadium D as a tracer\nA tracer is a substance that stands out in a crowd of similar material because it has unique qualities that make it easy to track.\nFor example, if you have a group of kindergartners going on a field trip and one of them is wearing a smartwatch, you can tell if the group went to the playground by tracking the GPS signal on the smartwatch. In de Hevesy\u2019s case, the kindergartners were the lead atoms, the smart watch was radium D, and the GPS signal was the emitted radioactivity.\nIn the 1910s, the Vienna Institute of Radium Research had a larger collection of radium and its byproducts than any other institution. To continue his experiments with radium D, de Hevesy moved to Vienna in 1912.\nHe collaborated with Fritz Paneth, who had also attempted the impossible task of separating radium D from lead without success. The two scientists \u201cspiked\u201d samples of different chemical compounds with small amounts of a radioactive tracer. This way they could study chemical processes by tracking the movement of the radioactivity across different chemical reactions\nDe Hevesy continued his work studying chemical processes using different isotopic markers for many years. He even was the first to introduce nonradioactive tracers. One nonradioactive tracer he studied was a heavier isotope of hydrogen, called deuterium. Deuterium is 10,000 times less abundant than common hydrogen, but is roughly twice as heavy, which makes it easier to separate the two.\nDe Hevesy and his co-author used deuterium to track water in their bodies. In their investigations, they took turns ingesting samples and measuring the deuterium in their urine to study the elimination of water from the human body.\nDe Hevesy was awarded the 1943 Nobel Prize in chemistry \u201cfor his work on the use of isotopes as tracers in the study of chemical processes.\u201d\nRadioactive tracers today\nMore than a century after de Hevesy\u2019s experiments, many fields now routinely use radioactive tracers, from medicine to materials science and biology.\nThese tracers can monitor the progression of disease in medical procedures, the uptake of nutrients in plant biology, the age and flow of water in aquifers and the measurement of wear and corrosion of materials, among other applications. Radioisotopes allow researchers to follow the paths of nutrients and drugs in living systems without invasively cutting the tissue.\nIn modern research, scientists focus on producing new isotopes and on developing procedures to use radioactive tracers more efficiently. The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, or FRIB, where the three of us work, has a program dedicated to the production and harvesting of unique radioisotopes. These radioisotopes are then used in medical and other applications.\nFRIB produces radioactive beams for its basic science program. In the production process, a large number of unused isotopes are collected in a tank of water, where they can be later isolated and studied.\nFacility for Rare Isotope Beams.\nOne recent study involved the isolation of the radioisotope Zn-62 from the irradiated water. This was a challenging task considering there were 100 quadrillion times more water molecules than Zn-62 atoms. Zn-62 is an important radioactive tracer utilized to follow the metabolism of zinc in plants and in nuclear medicine.\nEighty years ago, de Hevesy managed to take a dead-end separation project and turn it into a discovery that created a new scientific field. Radioactive tracers have already changed human lives in so many ways. Nevertheless, scientists are continuing to develop new radioactive tracers and find innovative ways to use them.", "url": "https://theconversation.com/how-a-disgruntled-scientist-looking-to-prove-his-food-wasnt-fresh-discovered-radioactive-tracers-and-won-a-nobel-prize-80-years-ago-214784", "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/551579/original/file-20231002-27-bnczk3.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C24%2C5460%2C2730&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2023-10-04T13:00:00Z", "source": {"name": "The Conversation UK", "url": "https://theconversation.com"}}, {"title": "Ad equity: Why it matters as retail media growth sweeps across SEA", "description": "\u201cWe know that strong brands are more resilient to inflation, for example. So use the platforms for building your brand \u2013 there are many formats and channels to do it,\u201d", "content": "Amid global economic uncertainty and unpredictability, marketers and advertisers are feeling the pinch as budget constraints emerge. More and more, marketers and advertising professionals are having to make their dollars work harder.\nAcross Southeast Asia, the rise of new channels has also led to the scattering of consumer attention. New engagement areas such as video streaming, superapps and social commerce are fast becoming hot favourites of consumers, and are having to compete with established digital platforms for advertising spend.\nHowever, not all media channels are created equal. Often, consumers can be more receptive to marketing messages on some platforms over others \u2013 which then make the path to customer engagement more complicated than ever before.\nAs marketing budgets continue to remain stagnant, and in some cases shrink, marketers need to find savvy ways to allocate their limited resources to build brand equity and boost sales.\nIntroducing ad equity\nThis is where ad equity comes in. Developed by leading marketing data and analytics company Kantar, ad equity measures how receptive consumers are to advertising messages across different media channels.\nAd equity also measures how likely consumers are to respond positively or negatively to a campaign. In fact, according to Kantar, done right, campaigns can be seven times more impactful amongst receptive audiences.\nTo help marketers with this benchmarking, every year Kantar ranks global and regional advertising platforms according to their ad equity score.\nThe most recent findings were published in the Media Reactions Report 2022, the third edition of Kantar\u2019s global ad equity ranking of media channels and media brands.\nWhile Google and Instagram were expected to emerge as top ad equity performers in SEA, an interesting arrival was Grab, which took position number three.\nGrab nabbing a position in the rankings also shows the potential of retail media. In fact, two out of the top five ad equity performers in SEA amongst consumers are retail media platforms \u2013 Grab (#3) and Shopee (#5).\nAccording to the report, ads on Grab are perceived to be less intrusive and repetitive compared to other media brands in the region, especially among female consumers. Additionally, Grab also tops the ad equity rankings amongst Gen Z consumers, who say ads on Grab are better quality than on other platforms.\nKantar also claims that other retail media brands in SEA such as Lazada and Shopee are also seen to be \u201crelevant and useful\u201d, while social media platforms such as TikTok, YouTube and Facebook come across as \u201cfun and entertaining\u201d.\nAccording to Priya Dudeja, media and creative effectiveness solutions lead at Kantar, superapps such as Grab or Shopee are perceived as relevant and trustworthy, and are \u201cincreasingly important to people\u201d. This could be due to the fact that over the past few years, superapps have grown to bring great utility to consumers, helping them to commute, shop, eat and pay for services.\nMore on the rise of retail media\nRetail media is a hot topic these days. But what exactly is retail media? And what does retail media look like in SEA?\nA relative newcomer to the region, retail media refers to advertising platforms that engage consumers at or near their point of purchase, or near a point of choice between competing brands. For instance, superapps such as Grab offer marketers a variety of advertising opportunities right at the point of purchase through:\nBanner ads\nLoyalty and reward gamification\nProduct sampling\nThis is possible because users complete the entire user journey, from discovery to consideration to purchase, within the superapp. Marketers can customise their messages according to the app and the role it plays in consumers\u2019 lives.\nDespite the channels available, one advice Kantar\u2019s Dudeja gives is that marketers should try to avoid \u201cshort-termism\u201d that just focuses on conversion.\n\u201cWe know that strong brands are more resilient to inflation, for example. So use the platforms for building your brand \u2013 there are many formats and channels to do it,\u201d she said.\nThis article was written in collaboration with GrabAds.", "url": "https://www.marketing-interactive.com/ad-equity-why-it-matters-as-retail-media-growth-sweeps-across-sea", "image": "https://marketing-interactive-assets.b-cdn.net/images/sg/banner/grab_ad_equity_lead.png?auto_optimize=medium", "publishedAt": "2023-10-04T02:19:36Z", "source": {"name": "Marketing Interactive", "url": "https://www.marketing-interactive.com"}}, {"title": "Quantum dots are part of a revolution in engineering atoms in useful ways - Nobel Prize for chemistry recognizes the power of nanotechnology", "description": "Quantum dots are a prime example of the way nanotechnology engineers materials at an atomic scale.", "content": "The 2023 Nobel Prize for chemistry isn\u2019t the first Nobel awarded for research in nanotechnology. But it is perhaps the most colorful application of the technology to be associated with the accolade.\nThis year\u2019s prize recognizes Moungi Bawendi, Louis Brus and Alexei Ekimov for the discovery and development of quantum dots. For many years, these precisely constructed nanometer-sized particles \u2013 just a few hundred thousandths the width of a human hair in diameter \u2013 were the darlings of nanotechnology pitches and presentations. As a researcher and adviser on nanotechnology, I\u2019ve even used them myself when talking with developers, policymakers, advocacy groups and others about the promise and perils of the technology.\nThe origins of nanotechnology predate Bawendi, Brus and Ekimov\u2019s work on quantum dots \u2013 the physicist Richard Feynman speculated on what could be possible through nanoscale engineering as early as 1959, and engineers like Erik Drexler were speculating about the possibilities of atomically precise manufacturing in the the 1980s. However, this year\u2019s trio of Nobel laureates were part of the earliest wave of modern nanotechnology where researchers began putting breakthroughs in material science to practical use.\nQuantum dots brilliantly fluoresce: They absorb one color of light and reemit it nearly instantaneously as another color. A vial of quantum dots, when illuminated with broad spectrum light, shines with a single vivid color. What makes them special, though, is that their color is determined by how large or small they are. Make them small and you get an intense blue. Make them larger, though still nanoscale, and the color shifts to red.\nThis property has led to many arresting images of rows of vials containing quantum dots of different sizes going from a striking blue on one end, through greens and oranges, to a vibrant red at the other. So eye-catching is this demonstration of the power of nanotechnology that, in the early 2000s, quantum dots became iconic of the strangeness and novelty of nanotechnology.\nBut, of course, quantum dots are more than a visually attractive parlor trick. They demonstrate that unique, controllable and useful interactions between matter and light can be achieved through engineering the physical form of matter \u2013 modifying the size, shape and structure of objects, for instance \u2013 rather than playing with the chemical bonds between atoms and molecules. The distinction is an important one, and it\u2019s at the heart of modern nanotechnology.\nSkip chemical bonds, rely on quantum physics\nThe wavelengths of light that a material absorbs, reflects or emits are usually determined by the chemical bonds that bind its constituent atoms together. Play with the chemistry of a material and it\u2019s possible to fine-tune these bonds so that they give you the colors you want. For instance, some of the earliest dyes started with a clear substance such as aniline, transformed through chemical reactions to the desired hue.\nIt\u2019s an effective way to work with light and color, but it also leads to products that fade over time as those bonds degrade. It also frequently involves using chemicals that are harmful to humans and the environment.\nQuantum dots work differently. Rather than depending on chemical bonds to determine the wavelengths of light they absorb and emit, they rely on very small clusters of semiconducting materials. It\u2019s the quantum physics of these clusters that then determines what wavelengths of light are emitted \u2013 and this in turn depends on how large or small the clusters are.\nThis ability to tune how a material behaves by simply changing its size is a game changer when it comes to the intensity and quality of light that quantum dots can produce, as well as their resistance to bleaching or fading, their novel uses and \u2013 if engineered smartly \u2013 their toxicity.\nOf course, few materials are completely nontoxic, and quantum dots are no exception. Early quantum dots were often based on cadmium selenide for instance \u2013 the component materials of which are toxic. However, the potential toxicity of quantum dots needs to be balanced by the likelihood of release and exposure and how they compare with alternatives.\nSince its earlier days, quantum dot technology has evolved in safety and usefulness and has found its way into an increasing number of products, from displays and lighting, to sensors, biomedical applications and more. In the process, some of their novelty has perhaps worn off. It can be hard to remember just how much of a quantum leap the technology is that\u2019s being used to promote the latest generation of flashy TVs, for instance.\nAnd yet, quantum dots are a pivotal part of a technology transition that\u2019s revolutionizing how people work with atoms and molecules.\n\u2018Base coding\u2019 on an atomic level\nIn my book \u201cFilms from the Future: the Technology and Morality of Sci-Fi Movies,\u201d I write about the concept of \u201cbase coding.\u201d The idea is simple: If people can manipulate the most basic code that defines the world we live in, we can begin to redesign and reengineer it.\nThis concept is intuitive when it comes to computing, where programmers use the \u201cbase code\u201d of 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s, albeit through higher level languages. It also makes sense in biology, where scientists are becoming increasingly adept at reading and writing the base code of DNA and RNA \u2013 in this case, using the chemical bases adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine as their coding language.\nThis ability to work with base codes also extends to the material world. Here, the code is made up of atoms and molecules and how they are arranged in ways that lead to novel properties.\nBawendi, Brus and Ekimov\u2019s work on quantum dots is a perfect example of this form of material-world base coding. By precisely forming small clusters of particular atoms into spherical \u201cdots,\u201d they were able to tap into novel quantum properties that would otherwise be inaccessible. Through their work they demonstrated the transformative power that comes through coding with atoms.\nThey paved the way for increasingly sophisticated nanoscale base coding that is now leading to products and applications that would not be possible without it. And they were part of the inspiration for a nanotechnology revolution that is continuing to this day. Reengineering the material world in these novel ways far transcends what can be achieved through more conventional technologies.\nThis possibility was captured in a 1999 U.S. National Science and Technology Council report with the title Nanotechnology: Shaping the World Atom by Atom. While it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention quantum dots \u2013 an omission that I\u2019m sure the authors are now kicking themselves over \u2013 it did capture just how transformative the ability to engineer materials at the atomic scale could be.\nThis atomic-level shaping of the world is exactly what Bawendi, Brus and Ekimov aspired to through their groundbreaking work. They were some of the first materials \u201cbase coders\u201d as they used atomically precise engineering to harness the quantum physics of small particles \u2013 and the Nobel committee\u2019s recognition of the significance of this is well deserved.", "url": "https://theconversation.com/quantum-dots-are-part-of-a-revolution-in-engineering-atoms-in-useful-ways-nobel-prize-for-chemistry-recognizes-the-power-of-nanotechnology-215015", "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/552184/original/file-20231004-19-i1snbm.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=6%2C274%2C4147%2C2073&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2023-10-03T13:00:00Z", "source": {"name": "The Conversation UK", "url": "https://theconversation.com"}}, {"title": "How to use the new Copilot AI in Windows 11", "description": "Copilot is very much like the AI you can chat with via Bing search, with a few Windows-specific features: the ability to launch apps, for example, or manage screenshots pasted to the clipboard.", "content": "You can\u2019t have missed Microsoft\u2019s attempts to stuff generative AI into almost everything it makes, from Bing search to the Windows OS. And it continues: the most recent update for Windows 11 has rolled out Copilot to all users.\nIf you\u2019re new to Copilot, it\u2019s very much like the AI you can chat with via Bing search, with a few Windows-specific features: the ability to launch apps, for example, or manage screenshots pasted to the clipboard.\nIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind that it\u2019s early days for the tool\nIn its announcement of the feature, Microsoft says that Copilot will \u201cuniquely incorporate the context and intelligence of the web, your work data and what you are doing in the moment on your PC to provide better assistance.\u201d However, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that it\u2019s early days for the tool, so you can\u2019t hand over all \u2014 or even many \u2014 of your computing tasks to it just yet. With that in mind, here\u2019s how to get started.\nLaunch Copilot\nBefore you begin, you probably want to make sure you\u2019re running the latest version of Windows 11: Copilot is part of the September 2023 Windows update.\nOpen Settings and then pick Windows Update .\n. Depending on where you are located geographically and how far down your PC is on Microsoft\u2019s update list, you may have to enable the Get the latest updates as soon as they\u2019re available toggle switch.\nTo launch Copilot, which shows up in a panel on the right of your screen, click the Copilot button on the taskbar, or press Win + C on the keyboard.\nBy the way, if you\u2019d rather Copilot not show up on the taskbar, head to Personalization > Taskbar in Settings, then turn Copilot off.\nUsing Copilot to control Windows\nDon\u2019t expect too much from Copilot\u2019s Windows integration just yet: at the time of writing, it\u2019s still labeled a \u201cpreview\u201d feature. Here are some cool little tricks I was able to do with it:\nType \u201cturn on dark mode\u201d to switch to Windows dark mode.\nType \u201copen Windows Settings\u201d to open the main Settings panel.\nType \u201claunch File Explorer\u201d to start browsing files on your PC.\nEven these integrations aren\u2019t particularly slick, though. In each case, you\u2019ll have to click Yes to confirm the action you want to take, and even then, Copilot will continue to babble on about what it\u2019s about to do before asking again if you want to perform the action (even when it\u2019s already done it). And a note: at least one of my colleagues reports that even this didn\u2019t work for her \u2014 when she asked Copilot to launch File Explorer, it said that it couldn\u2019t do it. Your results may vary.\nCopilot can sometimes be cooperative... ...and sometimes not.\nSomething that does work in a more seamless fashion is typing \u201ctake a screenshot\u201d \u2014 this launches Snipping Tool (just as pressing the PrtSc key does), no questions asked. Asking Copilot to \u201cchange the wallpaper\u201d works well, too, because it takes you straight to the Personalization page in Settings without any additional prompts.\nAs for integration with Windows\u2019 other apps, there\u2019s a long way to go. Ask Copilot to \u201cduplicate a slide\u201d in PowerPoint, for example, and it\u2019ll tell you how to do it (with instructions scraped from Bing) rather than actually doing it. Telling the bot to \u201ccreate a presentation on the benefits of Copilot\u201d only produces generic AI babble such as \u201cstart with a slide that introduces the topic and the main points you want to cover\u201d \u2014 yeah, thanks for that, Copilot.\nOf course, the Microsoft apps including PowerPoint are getting Copilot integrations of their own in the near future, though these features are not yet live for individuals and smaller organizations \u2014 and they\u2019re going to come with an extra fee attached.\nCopilot and everything else\nIf you\u2019ve used ChatGPT or any of the other generative AI text tools that have emerged, then you\u2019ll have a good idea of what you can do with Copilot.\nIf you\u2019ve used ChatGPT, Bing Chat (which is based on similar tech as ChatGPT), Google Bard, or any of the other generative AI text tools that have emerged in recent months, then you\u2019ll have a good idea of what else you can do with Copilot in Windows.\nYou can ask it to write poetry, predict fashion trends, compare smartphones against each other, come up with ideas for a kids party, explain difficult concepts in simple language, pull up a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, and plenty more.\nTo start a new chat with Copilot, click the three dots at the top of the panel and then choose Refresh. As well as removing what was already there, this will give you some suggestions about what you might want to ask: perhaps you want it to generate some C code or you need gift ideas for a particular type of friend.\nWhen you start a fresh Copilot conversation, you can pick from More Creative, More Balanced, and More Precise \u2014 the same options already available in Bing Chat on the web. In other words, you can sacrifice a little accuracy if you want more imaginative responses. There\u2019s also a microphone icon down in the lower-right corner, which you can click if you\u2019d rather speak your prompts aloud instead of typing them.\nWhen you start a fresh Copilot conversation, you can pick from the same options already available in Bing Chat.\nThere\u2019s only one setting in Copilot at the moment, but it\u2019s kind of an important one, and you can find it by clicking on the three dots at the top of the panel and choosing Settings. It\u2019s Let Copilot in Windows use Microsoft Edge content, and it essentially lets Copilot \u201csee\u201d what you\u2019re looking at in Edge.\nSo, for example, you could ask it to summarize a news article or explain some of the terms included on a page. You can even ask about pictures on a website \u2014 what they show, for example. However, this feature seemed a bit hit or miss in our testing, with Copilot occasionally getting answers wrong or not being able to view the content at all.", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/23899626/copilot-windows-11-how-to", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S98WFpNwYTFoWHzZTWoX9hs0p5M=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23952500/HT030_windows_0006.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-10-03T13:00:00Z", "source": {"name": "The Verge", "url": "https://www.theverge.com"}}, {"title": "RFK Jr. Issued an Apology on Twitter After Being Criticized About This Anne Frank Remark", "description": "Kennedy, a lifelong opponent of vaccinations, used Nazi Germany as an example in his Lincoln Memorial speech, which did not sit well with everyone.", "content": "At an anti-vaccine mandate demonstration in Washington, D.C., Robert F.

LOUIS (KMOV) -- Certain architectural landmarks immediately spring to mind when thinking of St. Louis. The Gateway Arch, for example, is one of the most recognizable monuments in the U.S., but it\u2019s not the only thing to celebrate on World Architecture Day on Monday, October 2.\nSome of the most revered architects have helped build the city, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Sullivan, Theodore Link, Eames and Young and Thomas P. Barnet. Design influences range from French Colonial, German, Early American, Victorian and Modern and represent a wide array of commercial, residential and monumental architecture throughout St. Louis.\nOne historical building turning heads lately is the old Butler Brothers building at Olive and 17th near CITYPARK.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the mountains, we don\u2019t have California weather, we don\u2019t have the ocean. What we do have is our built environment,\u201d Principal at Trivers Architects Joel Fuoss said.\nOrnate lions and intricate brickwork around the old Butler Brothers building look down on those who pass along 17th and Olive.\n\u201cThis was built in a different era,\u201d Fuoss shared. \u201cIn 1906 ornamentation was still celebrated. It still has two of its cornices left. At that time in history ornamentation was something that was really part of the design and that lost favor in the mid-20th century where design became much more streamlined and simpler.\u201d\nAn artifact of what St. Louis was.\n\u201cA lot of this architecture has an emotional response to people of something we don\u2019t necessarily do in the same way anymore,\u201d Fuoss said.\nA $130 million renovation project is wrapping up that will take this building that stood vacant for so long and transform it.\nThe Victor Apartments is the latest success story for Trivers Architects, a firm familiar with giving the region\u2019s structures of the past new life.\nTrivers, a local architecture, planning, urban design and interiors firm has 40 years of experience designing government, hospitality, education, business, cultural and civic structures throughout St. Louis. The development is also the result in-part of Missouri\u2019s historic tax credit program \u2013 dollars that can be coupled with the nation\u2019s historic tax credit program. Fuoss said this helps developers leverage expenses to take on bolder projects.\n\u201cI think when we see the new and the old together, that\u2019s when the magic happens,\u201d Fuoss said.\nBuilt in 1906, The Butler Building was a big part of the garment historic district.\n\u201cIt's location next to Union Station was pivotal and its ability to get goods in and out of St. Louis.\" Joel Fuoss with @Trivers_Arch told me. @KMOV pic.twitter.com/ZBXqGWyAdw \u2014 David Amelotti (@DavidAmelottiTV) October 2, 2023\nBuilt in 1906, The Butler Building was a big part of the garment historic district.\n\u201cIt\u2019s location next to Union Station was pivotal and its ability to get goods in and out of St. Louis,\u201d Fuoss explained. \u201cFor the first 50 years of its life, it was used for that purpose to bring goods in and out of St. Louis.\u201d\nIt fills an entire square city block, with more than 730,000 square feet of usable space. Now enclosed, a courtyard in the middle is carved out to connect the east and west entrances of the complex.\n\u201cIt was pavers that allowed horses to come in and out and all of these were overhead doors to the building,\u201d Fuoss explained. \u201cSo, we just saw this as an opportunity to create a central focus on this.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same reason Fuoss and his team at Trivers Architects kept the original loading dock doors as window fixtures.\n\u201cBeing a warehouse and this shipping and receiving that was so critical to the building, we saw this as an opportunity to not tear these out, let\u2019s just fix them in place, leave them so people see the history, the deterioration, those mechanical moments forever ingrained on that hardware and give some unique definition to this space,\u201d Fuoss said.\nFuoss said for the 384 apartment units, the goal was to create variation for residents.\n\u201cOur approach when we come at these projects is to do more with less,\u201d Fuoss shard. \u201cWhat we mean is using these elements of what\u2019s in the building to create these moments of intrigue and interest.\u201d\nIn the design phase, Fuoss said there is a commitment to taking pieces of the building\u2019s past to give them purpose to resonate with residents.\n\u201cWhen people come in it\u2019s not just surface-level fashion decision, this is interesting or what\u2019s going on in architecture,\u201d Fuoss explained. \u201cIt really has a resonance of something true of what this building is and what it stood for over its history.\u201d\nInside this massive space is a fitness center, lounges, workspaces, game rooms, a golf simulator, and a fireplace. A quick elevator to the roof reveals a pickleball court, a large-scale chess set, and a full-sized pool.\nAll amenities that benefit from the strong bones of a warehouse built more than 100 years ago.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wonderful about St. Louis is that we do have so much of this here and a lot of cities would die for the history we have,\u201d Fuoss shared. \u201cAnd sometimes we take it for granted.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why Fuoss said to make St. Louis a great destination, we have to elevate and expand our architectural beauty.\n\u201cOur environment is only what we make it,\u201d Fuoss explained. \u201cAll of these decisions are out there, buildings and structures, framework, and urban planning were all decisions made by humans and so it\u2019s on us to create spaces we want to be in.\u201d\nA look at St. Louis\u2019 architectural canvas!\nThe view of the downtown skyline from the Butler Brothers building.

An example shows just how much is at stake.", "content": "Each year, the federal government purchases about 50,000 new vehicles. Until recently, almost all of them ran on diesel or gasoline, contributing to U.S. demand for fossil fuels and encouraging automakers to continue focusing on fossil-fueled vehicles.\nThat\u2019s starting to change, and a new directive that the Biden Administration quietly issued in September 2023 will accelerate the shift.\nThe administration directed U.S. agencies to begin considering the social cost of greenhouse gases when making purchase decisions and implementing their budgets.\nThat one move has vast implications that go far beyond vehicles. It could affect decisions across the government on everything from agriculture grants to fossil fuel drilling on public lands to construction projects. Ultimately, it could shift demand enough to change what industries produce, not just for the government but for the entire country.\nWhat\u2019s the social cost of greenhouse gas?\nThe social cost of greenhouse gases represents the damage created by emitting 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.\nThese greenhouse gases, largely from fossil fuels, trap heat in the atmosphere, warming the planet and fueling climate change. The result is worsening storms, heat waves, droughts and other disasters that harm humans, infrastructure and economies around the world. The estimate is intended to include changes in agricultural productivity, human health, property damage from increased flood risk, and the value of ecosystem services.\nBy directing agencies to consider those costs when making purchases and implementing budgets, the administration is making it more likely that agencies will purchase products and make investments that are more energy efficient and less likely to fuel climate change.\nWhile only a fraction of the roughly $6 trillion that the U.S. government spends each year would likely be considered under the new directive, that fraction could have far-reaching impacts on the U.S. economy by reducing demand for fossil fuels and lowering emissions across sectors.\nEstimating the cost\nThe Obama administration introduced the first federal social cost of carbon to incorporate climate risk in regulatory decisions. It\u2019s calculated using models of the global economy and climate and weighs the value of spending money today for future benefits.\nWhen the Trump administration arrived, it cut the estimated cost from around $50 per metric ton to less than $5, which justified rolling back several environmental regulations, including on power plant emissions and fuel efficiency. The Biden administration restored an interim price to about $51, with plans to raise it.\nRecent research suggests that the actual social cost of carbon is closer to $185 per metric ton. But carbon dioxide is just one greenhouse gas. The new directive takes other greenhouse gases into consideration, too \u2013 in particular, methane, which has about 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over 20 years.\nEstimates of the social cost of methane, which comes from livestock and leaks from pipelines and other natural gas equipment, range from $933 per metric ton to $4,000 per metric ton.\nWithout directives like these, decision-makers implicitly set the cost of greenhouse gas emissions to zero in their benefit-cost analyses. The new directives allow agencies to instead compare the expected climate damages, in dollars, when making decisions about vehicle purchases, building infrastructure and permitting, among other choices.\nThe vehicle fleet as an example\nThe federal vehicle fleet is a good example of how the social costs of greenhouse gases add up.\nLet\u2019s compare the costs of driving an electric Ford Focus and an equivalent conventional-fuel Ford Focus.\nAssume each vehicle drives an average of 10,000 miles (about 16,000 kilometers) per year \u2013 that\u2019s less than the U.S. average per driver, but it\u2019s a simple number to work with. The damages from emissions in dollars from driving a conventional Ford Focus 10,000 miles are between $133 and $484, depending on whether you use a social cost of carbon of $51 per metric ton or $185 per metric ton.\nThe climate harm from driving an equivalent electric Ford Focus 10,000 miles, based on the average carbon dioxide emissions intensity from the U.S. electricity grid, would be between $59 and $212, using the same social costs.\nScale that to 50,000 new vehicle purchases, and that\u2019s a cost difference of about $4 million to $13.5 million per year for emissions from operating the vehicles. While producing an EV\u2019s battery adds to the vehicle\u2019s emissions up front, that\u2019s soon outweighed by operational savings. These are real savings to society.\nThe U.S. government is also a major consumer of energy. If agencies begin to consider the climate damages associated with fossil energy consumption, they will likely trend toward renewable energy, further lowering their own emissions while boosting the burgeoning industry.\nHow the government can shift demand\nThese types of comparisons under the new directive could help shift purchases toward a wide range of less carbon-intensive products.\nMuch of the U.S. government\u2019s spending goes toward carbon-intensive goods and services, such as transportation and infrastructure development. Directing agencies to consider and compare the social cost of purchases in each of these sectors will send similar signals to different segments of the market: The demand for less carbon-intensive goods is rising.\nBecause this new directive expands to other greenhouse gases, it could have broad implications for new permitting for oil and gas development and agricultural production, as these are the two largest sources of methane in the U.S.\nWhile this decision is not a tax on carbon or a subsidy for less carbon-intensive goods, it will likely send similar market signals. With respect to purchases, this policy is akin to tax rebates for energy efficient products, like electric vehicle incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, which boost demand for EVs.\nUltimately, if one of the largest segments of demand, the U.S. government, transitions to less carbon-intensive products, supply will follow.", "url": "https://theconversation.com/climate-change-is-about-to-play-a-big-role-in-government-purchases-with-vast-implications-for-the-us-economy-214549", "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/551043/original/file-20230928-21-6jlfb6.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C777%2C4190%2C2095&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "publishedAt": "2023-10-02T13:00:00Z", "source": {"name": "The Conversation UK", "url": "https://theconversation.com"}}, {"title": "Jenson Button eyeing full-time seat as F1 icon to follow Fernando Alonso example", "description": "Jenson Button last raced in Formula 1 back in 2017 but the former world champion is eyeing up a return to the track having sampled several different series in recent years", "content": "Want the day's sports headlines straight to your inbox?

He's participated in the World Endurance Championship, Le Mans, Super GT, DTM and NASCAR.\nNow he is looking to debut in the IMSA SportsCar Championship, racing for JDC-Miller MotorSports in the 26th staging of the Motul Petit Le Mans on October 14 - which he hopes can become a long-term project with the 43-year-old adamant he has plenty to offer.\nButton said on his plans: \u201cThere are a few very good options.\" He then added: \u201cEndurance is the place I want to be. Multiclass racing throws something else into the mix with traffic. There\u2019s always a lot more action because of it. The way IMSA is run, you don\u2019t know who is going to win until after the last safety car, basically. Endurance racing is where it\u2019s at.\u201d\nThe IMSA website claims Button is looking to bag himself a full-time drive in 2024 with a view to extending in 2025. Going from F1 to sportscar racing is a relatively common route and a host of drivers who used to be on the grid have extended their careers in other formulas.\nButton's former team-mate Fernando Alonso is currently showing how age is no barrier to performing at the top level. The Spaniard returned to F1 several years ago with Alpine but this year moved to Aston Martin, where he's recorded seven podiums, leaving him fourth in the standings.\n(Image: Michael Potts/BSR Agency/Getty Images)\nHe's been in the mix for race wins this season with his package particularly competitive towards the beginning of the year. Alonso is still exercising the enthusiasm of youth and Button has every intention of following his lead, insisting he feels half his age.\nThe Brit said: \u201cIt never leaves you as a racing driver, that want for competition. As long as I still want to race and am still healthy and fit and my reactions are still there, there\u2019s no reason to stop racing. When I get to a point where I\u2019ve lost my edge, I won\u2019t be doing so much serious racing.\n\"But for now, wow! I feel like I\u2019ve got a lot of years ahead.

Picture; Adam Head\nWhile his defence has never been an issue, Cleary\u2019s attack has been questioned at times \u2013 particularly in the State of Origin arena \u2013 with critics calling him out for being too structured.\nHe\u2019s addressed that over the years with the gun halfback producing one of his finest performances in the first week of the finals when he set up a try with one boot on and scored a stunning solo try in the big win over the Warriors.\n\u201cPart of it was being able to learn from the outside noise and not let that affect my game, but also learning about my own game,\u201d he said when asked about the ongoing criticism.\n\u201cThe majority of time, criticism is warranted, but I\u2019m also critical of myself. I\u2019m trying to assess my own game and grow from that, and I\u2019m still doing that to this day trying ways to try to get better.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the beautiful thing about rugby league. It\u2019s not a black and white game where you\u2019re always going to have it down pat. Every game is different and there are lots of grey areas and lots of areas to get better in.\u201d\nOn the flip side, there are those who say Cleary is destined to be an NRL Immortal when he retires and that a third title in a row would have him in the same conversation as Andrew Johns or Johnathan Thurston as the greatest ever No.7.\nHigh praise can be just as daunting for a player whose career has been in the spotlight since he debuted as an 18-year-old, but Cleary has worked on ways to deal with it as he continues to shine brightest in a team full of stars.\nCleary could go down as one of the greatest players of all time if he keeps playing like he is right now. Picture; Matt King/Getty Images\n\u201cEarlier in my career, people were complimenting me when I first came in because I came in as a young kid and was going all right, but then it flips pretty quickly,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA lot of the time you get the compliments, it\u2019s so people can build you up just so they can drag you back down.\n\u201cAnother thing that I\u2019ve learnt is that if you read too much into the compliments then the negative comments will affect you a lot more so you\u2019ve got to stay on that equilibrium of what you believe in yourself and what you believe of the opinions of those close to you.\u201d\nIt\u2019s why he didn\u2019t bite when asked if a win against Brisbane would make Penrith the greatest team of the NRL era, with Cleary content to let his footy do the talking.", "url": "https://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/people-build-you-up-just-so-they-can-drag-you-back-down-inside-clearys-evolution-to-become-the-games-greatest/news-story/908e557cbeedf94cfb3ddeaba3c3d1be", "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c24f9160793da3c0b86a7b654f3f5e9f", "publishedAt": "2023-09-30T01:22:00Z", "source": {"name": "NEWS.com.au", "url": "https://www.news.com.au"}}, {"title": "For millions, 'Bidenomics' is a painful joke.

If you look up the word \"Bidenomics\" on the White House website, you'll find example after example of President Joe Biden praising the group of economic policies named after him. But now, there are reports the president's embrace of the term Bidenomics might be backfiring.\nThe word actually came from the media, and it wasn't a compliment. On June 8, the Wall Street Journal published an analysis of what Biden national security adviser Jake Sullivan called \"a modern American industrial strategy,\" defined as an economy, under Biden, in which \"a more assertive federal government guides investment, industry, and trade.\" Some of Biden's critics, and opponents of that strategy, adopted the term to use against him.\nBiden didn't like it. On June 28, a reporter noted that Biden had earlier said he didn't know \"what the hell Bidenomics is.\" But the questioner then suggested that the White House was \"branding\" the president's policies under the word Bidenomics. \"Look, you guys branded it, I didn't,\" Biden snapped. \"I never called it 'Bidenomics.' ... Let's get it straight. The first time it was used was in the Wall Street Journal, OK? I don't go around beating my chest, 'Bidenomics.' So the press started calling it 'Bidenomics.'\"\nSubscribe today to the Washington Examiner magazine that will keep you up to date with what's going on in Washington. SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue!\nA short time later, though, Biden changed his mind. Bidenomics became a good word. On July 6, Biden traveled to Columbia, South Carolina, and delivered an entire speech devoted to his new favorite phrase. \"Bidenomics is just another way of saying 'restoring the American dream,'\" Biden said. Among other things, Biden continued, \"the pay for low-wage workers has grown at the fastest pace in two decades \u2014 and folks, it's no accident. It's Bidenomics in action.\"\nFrom then on, the president started using Bidenomics frequently to claim credit for what he said were great economic improvements resulting from his policies. There was only one problem. Majorities of voters are very unhappy about the economy now. They are suffering from high prices and diminished purchasing power, and they don't want to hear the president telling them how great things are as a result of Bidenomics.\nJust look at the recent Washington Post-ABC News poll, which found that Biden's rating for his handling of the economy is at a \"career low.\" Just 30% approve, while 64% disapprove. For starters, the price of food is a disaster \u2014 91% view it negatively. The price of gas and energy is almost as bad \u2014 87% view it negatively. And then there is the bigger problem of workers' incomes \u2014 75% view that negatively.\nShort version: People are not happy. And when they hear the president heaping praise on \"Bidenomics\" \u2014 well, they don't react well.\n\"Several top Biden allies have privately raised concerns about the phrase to the White House,\" Politico reported. \"Rep. Steven Horsford, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, said in an interview this week that he has warned the White House that the Bidenomics brand is built on shaky ground.\"\nMore from Politico: \"Their worries are underscored by a slew of polling showing that the economic recovery the White House has sought to spotlight as a triumph is not making a dent in the public's psyche. Most Americans are still skeptical that U.S. is in an upturn, let alone one resilient enough to last much longer.\" It does not take a rocket scientist to figure that one out. Read a few polls, go to the grocery store, and you've got it.\nOther than Biden's age, this is the president's biggest political vulnerability going into 2024. And it's an obvious opportunity for Republican candidates to pound him mercilessly. Certainly his chief rival, former President Donald Trump, sees a big, fat target called \"Bidenomics.\"\nIn a recent campaign stop in Summerville, South Carolina, Trump mocked the president for giving his name to bad economic times. \"We're going to end the economic catastrophe known as Bidenomics,\" Trump told the crowd. \"You know, he thought that was good, but it was meant to be bad. It was originally done in the financial pages to talk about how bad it was, and he said, Oh, I love the name, I love the name. So now he goes around and he talks about it like it's good. It's really bad.\" In his speech, Trump listed a number of steps he would take \"to rescue our workers, manufacturers, and small businesses from the burning wreckage of Bidenomics.\u201d\nThat's just Politics 101 \u2014 focus relentlessly on your opponent's weakness. And don't forget to mock, too, especially when the target is a vainglorious term like Bidenomics. And that makes it a little mysterious that the other Republican candidates did not make their recent debate an opportunity to bash the president over Bidenomics. In fact, just two candidates ever uttered the word during the debate.\nGov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) said, \"People are hurting out there. So we've got to address the underlying problem, with Bidenomics, the overspending. Taking all of Biden's rules and regulations, I'm going to throw them in the trash can on day one.\" Then former Vice President Mike Pence said, \"I've got to tell you, while the union bosses are talking about class warfare and talking about disparity in wages, I really believe what's driving that is Bidenomics has failed. Wages are not keeping up with inflation.\"\nThat was it. Vivek Ramaswamy, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Chris Christie, Doug Burgum \u2014 all were critical of Biden, of course, but none took the opportunity to throw Bidenomics in the president's face. That borders on political malpractice.\nWhat now? Will Biden continue to put his name proudly on a set of policies that have meant economic woes for millions of people? Will Trump, and perhaps his fellow Republicans, too, turn Bidenomics into both an object of ridicule and a mark of shame? Will Biden get the message and back away from his own name? It could be that in a few months, the president and his staff will be acting like they never said the word.\nFor a deeper dive into many of the topics covered in the Daily Memo, please listen to my podcast, The Byron York Show \u2014 available on Radio America and the Ricochet Audio Network and everywhere else podcasts can be found.", "url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/for-millions-bidenomics-is-a-painful-joke-joe-biden-loves-it", "image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71440a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4153x2180+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmediadc-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2Fdd%2Fd39c3d264fecbd541c069a35b0cd%2Fap23272583456038.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-09-29T23:34:27Z", "source": {"name": "Washington Examiner", "url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com"}}, {"title": "Modi's 3rd term goal 'inspires' BJP ticket-seekers in their 70s.

He contested and won from his traditional seat of Manjalpur.\nRaghuvanshi was last month declared the BJP candidate from Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Chanderi seat, and this has given hope to party leaders in their early and mid-70s \u2014 in both the MP and Rajasthan units \u2014 that they are not too old to get tickets for upcoming polls in the two states.\nNew Delhi: Aged 75, Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP\u2019s) Jagannath Singh Raghuvanshi has become quite a talking point among the older leaders of the party.\nSince Narendra Modi and Amit Shah took over the reins of the BJP, there has been an unwritten cut-off age of 75 years for contesting elections or being in the government.\nNow, the ticket to Raghuvanshi has come as yet another indication of the party\u2019s willingness to relax the unofficial age ceiling. It\u2019s, however, Prime Minister Modi\u2019s unequivocal message about serving a full third term, if the BJP retains power, that has given hope to the party\u2019s septuagenarians who aren\u2019t ready to hang up their boots just yet.\nThey have pointed out that the PM, who turned 73 earlier this month, has led the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre for two straight terms and has been announced as leader of the BJP\u2019s campaign for 2024 as well.\nSeveral BJP MLAs in their 70s ThePrint spoke to said that Modi was their \u201cideal\u201d, being \u201cstill physically fit to lead the nation for a third term\u201d. Likewise, the leaders argued, they too were fit to lead their constituency and should not be denied tickets. A few in their 80s expressed the same hope.\nOne such ticket aspirant is 73-year-old Premshanker Kunjilal Verma, BJP MLA from Seoni-Malwa seat in Madhya Pradesh. Verma is said to have a hold over the Other Backward Class (OBC) voters in his constituency and is thus optimistic that he will be given a ticket again.\n\u201cAge is not the criteria, winnability is. Our ideal is PM Modi, who is not only physically fit and touring one country after another, but also working overnight despite completing 73 years. I too am physically fit and all my senses are working. So, I am ready to fight the election,\u201d he asserted. \u201cWe all are taking inspiration from the PM and we have to look after only our constituency.\u201d\nIn Rajasthan, the ticket aspirants include MLAs Kali Charan Saraf, Pabba Ram Bishnoi, both aged 72, and Vasudev Devnani, 73, a state BJP functionary told ThePrint, adding that the leaders believe they are fit to contest elections and have the winnability quotient as well.\nIt is, however, understood within BJP circles that the age of retirement from the party is 75 years, which means leaders above this age are discouraged from contesting elections.\nThe party has in previous elections also denied tickets to veterans such as B.S. Yediyurappa, now 80, in Karnataka, and Eknath Khadse, now 71, in Maharashtra.\nThe senior ticket aspirants\u2019 demands also come at a time when the BJP is said to be looking for fresh faces for elections.\nA senior leader from the Rajasthan BJP admitted that the \u201cinduction of younger people in the organisation and electoral field is a conscious strategy to make the party outfit younger\u201d. But, he added, \u201cit is also true that the party can\u2019t use the age criteria to retire competent people\u201d.\n\u201cIt can\u2019t use two yardsticks for giving tickets. If age is not the criteria for the PM because he is winning, the same logic should be applied to deserving senior leaders who are winning. The criteria should not be applied to shunt out such leaders,\u201d the leader further said.\nSatyanarayan Jatiya, a 77-year-old Dalit leader from Madhya Pradesh, who was inducted into the BJP\u2019s parliamentary board last year, told ThePrint that the party had no rule barring those above 75 years of age from contesting elections.\nAlso Read: Why MP CM Chouhan is telling \u2018non-performing\u2019 BJP MLAs to \u2018mend ways before it\u2019s too late\u2019\n\u2018I am hopeful\u2019\nIn MP, there are 16 MLAs above 70 years of age and most are hopeful that they will get a ticket, sources in the BJP state unit said.\nMLA Paras Jain, 73, who first got elected from Ujjain in 1990 and has since won all elections barring one from the seat, is one such hopeful.\n\u201cThe party will decide tickets but I am ready to fight the election. Tickets are given on winnability. If a person aged 50 years is not physically fit, will the party select him? The PM is 73 but he has more energy than young people. I am not going to retire as the party can use experienced people,\u201d he told ThePrint.\nState minister and eight-time MLA from Rehli, Gopal Bhargava, now 71, also wishes to fight the next election. Addressing a rally in his constituency recently, he announced: \u201cI will fight the election this time also.\u201d\nSix-time MLA Gopilal Jatav, 75, who holds the Guna seat, told ThePrint that he was \u201csure to get a ticket as the party has given one to Jagganath Singhji from Chanderi who is more senior than me\u201d. He, however, added that this would be his last election.\nNagod MLA Nagendra Singh, 80, is also optimistic about getting a ticket. He said, \u201cThe party will decide but I am physically fit and working in my constituency. I am hopeful.\u201d\nAccording to Sitasaran Sharma, the 73-year-old BJP MLA from Narmadapuram who was MP assembly Speaker from 2014 to 2019, state BJP president V.D. Sharma had said that \u201cage will not be criteria for tickets but winnability will be\u201d.\nIn Rajasthan too, ageing BJP leaders are said to be pressuring the party for another chance in the elections, citing their fitness and winnability.\nEarlier this month, six-time BJP MLA Suryakanta Vyas, 85, took on the party brass over poll tickets, reacting to Union minister Gajendra Shekhawat\u2019s statement during the BJP Parivartan Yatra in Nagaur \u2014 where he talked about the advanced years of Vyas and former Rajasthan assembly Speaker Kailash Meghwal, 89.\n\u201c(Hindi author) Munshi Premchand has written in one of his stories that old age is often a repetition of childhood and such mistakes are made in childhood,\u201d the Union minister had reportedly said.\nVyas retorted: \u201cI will fight the election despite what Shekhawat is saying. I have been in politics since even before Shekhawat was born. Even C.P. Joshi and Rajendra Rathore touch my feet. He should learn manners first.\u201d\n\u2018Age rule can be bent for Modiji\u2019\nThe age controversy started in the BJP in 2019, when the party dropped more than 20 veteran MPs who were above 75 years of age.\nL.K. Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sumitra Mahajan, Kalraj Mishra, B.S. Koshiyari, B.C. Khanduri, Karia Munda, Shanta Kumar, Hukumdev Narayan Yadav, Satyanarayan Jatia and Satrughan Sinha were told to retire from politics.\nAdvani had shown displeasure about the way the party communicated its decision to him. Former Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan wrote an open letter announcing her retirement, citing the party\u2019s indecision about her parliamentary seat. Murli Manohar Joshi told voters of Kanpur that he was told by his party to not contest the national election from the constituency and look for a seat elsewhere.\nWhile Ramlal, then BJP organisational general secretary, requested them over phone to announce that they are opting out of the polls, Advani and Joshi did not toe the party diktat. Later, then BJP chief Amit Shah replaced Advani in Gandhinagar seat to contest his first Lok Sabha election.\nBack then, Shah had told a news magazine that it was the party\u2019s decision to not give poll tickets to those above 75 years of age. But with Modi now ready for another term, veteran leaders are citing physical fitness and winnability as the main criteria for tickets.\nGaurishankar Bisen, 71, who was last month inducted into the MP cabinet, told ThePrint: \u201cModiji has defied age. India has never seen a PM like Modi. He is fit and new heights have been achieved under his leadership. The age rule can be bent for him as the country requires his leadership.\u201d\nNot just legislators, veteran parliamentarians are also optimistic that the age embargo will be relaxed while deciding tickets.\nSome have already started speaking about it. This June, MP Hema Malini, 74, told the media that if she had to contest the next election, she would contest from Mathura and no other seat.\nOther prominent MPs who are optimistic about getting tickets include Ramapati Ram Tripathi, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, Santosh Gangwar, Satyadev Pachauri, Radha Mohan Singh, Sadananda Gowda, Shripad Naik and Kirron Kher, according to BJP sources.\nThere are also leaders who have volunteered to retire and asked the party to give younger workers a chance to fight elections. MLA Mohan Ram, 72, who got elected from Nagaur in Rajasthan, told ThePrint: \u201cI have communicated to the party to find another candidate for my seat. I am setting a precedent \u2014 the party should bring younger people in.\u201d\n(Edited by Nida Fatima Siddiqui)\nAlso Read: \u2018Shouldn\u2019t deny deserving candidate ticket because he\u2019s from political family\u2019, says Sumitra Mahajan", "url": "https://theprint.in/politics/modis-3rd-term-goal-inspires-bjp-ticket-seekers-in-their-70s-ticket-to-75-yr-old-in-mp-raises-hopes/1782034/", "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/jagannath.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-09-29T05:48:12Z", "source": {"name": "ThePrint", "url": "https://theprint.in"}}, {"title": "Manchester United fans told to look to Pep Guardiola for guidance on Alejandro Garnacho", "description": "Pep Guardiola's development of Phil Foden is a good example of how Manchester United should help grow Alejandro Garnacho.That's according to former Re", "content": "Pep Guardiola's development of Phil Foden is a good example of how Manchester United should help grow Alejandro Garnacho.\nThat's according to former Red Devils star Dimitar Berbatov, who insists the youngster needs time to flourish at the club.\n3 Garnacho really seems to be finding his feet at United Credit: Getty\nGarnacho joined the Old Trafford academy from Atletico Madrid in 2020 and is one of the club's most exciting young prospects.\nHe has already enjoyed plenty of experience in the United first-team, having made 42 senior appearances.\nThe 19-year-old has made three starts this season and scored in the 3-0 Carabao Cup win over Crystal Palace.\nIt's clear that Erik ten Hag trusts the young Argentina international but Berbatov wants to ensure that his development is not rushed.\nSpeaking to Betfair, he said: \"It was great to see Garnacho get on the score sheet in the week, people want him to play more at United but he needs time.\n\"I think Ten Hag is showing enough faith in Garnacho and deciding the right times for him to play. He's very, very young - just 19 - and you need to be careful not to rush things and try not to be impatient.\"\nHe then spoke of how Foden was slowly but surely integrated into the Manchester City side by Guardiola, with the England international now one of the first names on the team sheet.\nBerbatov added: \"Look at how Guardiola treated Foden, he was brought in slowly and had to answer questions about why he was not playing.

Construction on the building, owned by real estate investment trust company InterRent, finished last year.\nAs Canadian politicians and policy thinkers try to come up with ways to solve a growing housing crisis, the project is one example of a novel solution for some urban centres.\nThe conversion of office buildings into housing is a trending topic. And vacancy rates in many downtowns are growing. But experts say the same kinds of barriers that have contributed to the housing shortage writ large are also at play for companies seeking to retrofit existing buildings.\nCLV Group president Oz Drewniak said in an interview that office conversions have a heap of benefits, including adding vibrancy to neighbourhoods, reducing crime, expanding customer bases for local businesses and increasing public transit ridership in downtown cores.\nDrewniak said it has an upside for sustainability, too, because keeping structures in place contains the millions of kilograms in carbon dioxide emissions that are embedded in the concrete of old commercial buildings.\nHe estimated for The Slayte, renovating the unused office building, rather than completely tearing it down and building anew, would save the need for 770 trucks worth of concrete.\nDrewniak said though there\u2019s no \u201csilver bullet\u201d to the housing crisis, office conversion is one of the many pieces to the puzzle.\n\u201cEvery option has to be looked at,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe need municipalities to do whatever they can to speed up development, to provide incentives to get moving.\u201d\nSteven Paynter, a director and architect in Toronto with the Gensler architecture and planning firm, has created an algorithm along with his colleagues that calculates the viability of converting offices into homes.\nHe said of the nearly 1,000 buildings in Canada and the United States that Gensler has assessed for residential retrofitting, about 25 to 30 per cent fit the criteria for conversion.\nPaynter said the feasibility of an office metamorphosis is dependent on the existing conditions of an office building, such as the floorplate and window layouts.\nIn the transformation of The Slayte, everything but the concrete foundation and some elevators in the building was stripped or demolished. Even its core was modified so as to create bigger rooms.\nThough a faster construction processes lead to savings on interest, overall costs are the same as developing a new apartment building, Drewniak said, because of costly demolition and structural reinforcing.\n\u201cThe cost of the windows, the cost of the flooring and the cost of electrical, all that kind of stuff \u2013 there\u2019s no difference in cost between brand new and conversion,\u201d he said while giving The Canadian Press a tour of the Slayte on Monday.\nA recent study by commercial real estate firm CBRE shows Canada\u2019s national office vacancy rate is just over 18 per cent and continues to rise, though it varies from city to city.\nPaynter estimated that around seven per cent of vacant offices in major city centres will actually be turned into housing, based on other factors such as commercial real estate loans.\n\u201cIt might not sound like much, but it\u2019s huge,\u201d said Paynter.\nIn Ottawa, the number could be much higher. About 40 per cent of the buildings Paynter ran through his algorithm were viable for conversion.\nThe federal government is disposing of 10 office buildings in the National Capital Region, as more public servants work from home. And the city\u2019s downtown vacancy rate is above 15 per cent and rapidly increasing, according to CBRE.\n\u201cWherever we can do conversions and build more housing, and have more people living downtown we\u2019re open to that, but obviously it\u2019s got to be in the right circumstances,\u201d Ottawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe said during a news conference earlier this month.\nA report this year by the Canadian Urban Institute that looked at conditions that enable office conversions \u2013 such as municipal policy, market viability and building types \u2013 said Ottawa could convert 11 to 17 buildings and create 1,500 to 4,200 new housing units.\n\u201cBased on the modelling, Ottawa has the most potential for conversions,\u201d the institute\u2019s report says.\n\u201cThis is largely due to the size of the city as one of Canada\u2019s largest (and a larger building inventory overall), but it is notable that there are a significant number of high and low-rise, mid-century buildings considered feasible for conversion.\u201d\nBoth Paynter and Drewniak said Calgary offers an example of how municipalities can promote downtown office conversions.\nThat city\u2019s program, which has funded more than 700 homes, provides a $75 incentive per square foot of converted space. A special team is dedicated to expediting the permit and approval process.\nIf Ottawa had a similar policy, the savings it created could result in renters spending more than $300 less a month for units built under the program, Drewniak said.\nIt would speed things up, too. Paynter said while it takes up to two years to get a project approved in other major Canadian cities, it takes only four to six weeks in Calgary.\nLacklustre municipal policies are a chief barrier preventing more office conversions from happening, he said.\nAnother is the high cost of construction, which Paynter said combined with high borrowing costs make development projects harder to budget.\n\u201cThe federal government\u2019s scrapping of GST on rental buildings will be a big help, once they clarify that it applies to conversion,\u201d he said, referring to an announcement the Liberals made last week as part of efforts to boost the housing supply in Canada.\nThe Liberals\u2019 2021 election platform promised that $600-million would be spent on converting office spaces into market-based housing.\nNeither the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. nor Housing Minister Sean Fraser\u2019s office responded to a question about whether the pledge was honoured.\n\u201cTo date there has been no word on how this will be spent, but recently CMHC has had a renewed focus on conversions, so it may come through that,\u201d said Paynter about the pledge.\nHe said he hopes some of that committed funding will be spent on converting office assets the government has decided to dispose of.\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has promised to sell 15 per cent of federal buildings and land to support housing in a recently tabled bill.\nPaynter said the idea has really picked up steam in the last six months, first accelerated by the pandemic and virtual work.\n\u201cI think that\u2019s because we\u2019re starting to see the return to work stabilize,\u201d said Paynter.\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re all also starting to see that people very clearly want to be in more desirable buildings with really close proximity to transit.\u201d", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-turning-offices-into-homes-could-help-address-the-housing-crisis-but/", "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/jgN-yT7d7HdzxeS7wcoey5to01g=/1200x800/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tgam/X5OCUXGKRJP4HGS55UDDJ3Z4LA.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-09-27T17:00:18Z", "source": {"name": "The Globe and Mail", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com"}}, {"title": "Volley of FIFA games delisted as EA Sports FC 24 releases", "description": "FIFA 23 and older titles from the series are vanishing from storefronts for PC and consoles, right as the latest game from EA releases.Looking up FIFA 23 on Steam, for example, throws up the following", "content": "FIFA 23 and older titles from the series are vanishing from storefronts for PC and consoles, right as the latest game from EA releases.\nLooking up FIFA 23 on Steam, for example, throws up the following message. \"Notice: At the request of the publisher, EA SPORTS FIFA 23 is unlisted on the Steam store and will not appear in search.\"\nAs The Gamer reports, this has been the case for six days at the time of writing.

It showed Max Verstappen leading the race in his RB19 while his closest challenger \u2013 Lando Norris was visible in the distance on the other side of the figure-of-eight Suzuka circuit. That was enough to showcase how dominantly Verstappen won the Japanese GP. A winning margin of 19.7 seconds in dry conditions is insane from the Dutch Lion. However, there was a slight difference in how Verstappen tackled Lando Norris\u2018 threat at the race start in Suzuka.\nAmerica\u2019s Favorite Video Today\nUsually, it is Charles Leclerc, Lewis Hamilton, or someone like Russell or Sainz who challenges Max into Turn 1 of any race. While Lando Norris did so at the British GP (and did it pretty well: leading for multiple laps), the wily Dutchman probably knew he would have the measure of the McLaren man eventually.\nIs Max Verstappen racing leniently against Lando Norris?\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nRewinding back to the British GP, Lando Norris starting in P2 got an excellent start. He cut off Verstappen nicely to take the lead. While the Brit knew that Max would eventually pass him, he had his elbows out at lights out. Although, what about Max\u2019s side of the court in this tussle?\nThe Red Bull man is quite good friends with Norris & probably knows his racing style the best. On top of that, Lando has never regularly been in this position to fight with Max like Leclerc, Hamilton, or even Sainz or Russell. Thus, there is a slight possibility that Verstappen has some double standards in his racing approach toward Norris relative to Leclerc & the others.\nEven F1 veteran & journalist Peter Windsor shed light on the same in his Japanese GP analysis. He stated, \u201cAnd Lando was ahead as they went through the first part, the kink, the right kink. He is definitely ahead. There was a moment there, if he had been a George or dare I say Kevin Magnussen, probably a Charles Leclerc as well; I think he would have gone for it.\u201d\nWindsor cited that Lando understands when to attack & fall back depending on the situation. Therefore, Verstappen may have noticed Norris not going for it & exploited this half-hearted attempt. Peter added, \u201cHe was almost there but then he gave the position to Max. I think from Max\u2019s point of view, again the psychology of the individual, he was thinking: umm this isn\u2019t Charles, this isn\u2019t George, this is Lando; I think I have got this, I know I have got this. Put the head down, go! And so it proved.\u201d\nSome may call it double standards, some may call it a dynamic racing approach. Regardless, Verstappen is getting results & tackling the threat posed by multiple drivers in such situations. Norris is just the latest in the list of his victims. Yet, the McLaren man has shown some daring speed to take it up to Max. The crucial question is can he actually match & beat Verstappen over the course of a season?\nWhen can Norris\u2019s hopes of beating Verstappen be fulfilled?\nAfter getting a sniff at victory (rather from a long distance of 20 seconds), Norris is bullish about catching Red Bull. While McLaren has been spectacular after their multiple upgrade packages, it may be a steep claim for the Woking team to beat Red Bull on merit this season. Unless Verstappen & Co. experience another Singapore till the end of the year, Lando may have to keep his Max-beating ambitions at bay.\nADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad\nThe realistic timeline for McLaren & Norris to catch up to RBR should be 2024.

But several prominent members of the Steelers during that era feel that it played a major role in the outcomes of two AFC title games.\nFormer Steelers Joey Porter and wideout Hines Ward have previously shared how they feel Spygate impacted those games, which were both won by New England. This week, former Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and Hall of Fame running back Jerome Bettis reignited the conversation. The topic was broached after Bettis recalled his initial thoughts when then-rookie Roethlisberger vowed during the final seconds of Pittsburgh's 2004 title game loss to New England that he would get Bettis to the following year's Super Bowl if he didn't retire.\n\"If your ass hadn't thrown two interceptions, we'd be in the Super Bowl!,\" Bettis recalled while laughing during his appearance on Roethlisberger's podcast.\n\"To be fair, the Patriots cheated,\" Roethlisberger said in return.\n\"For sure they did,\" Bettis said. \"There's not even a question in my mind.\"\nBettis then provided an example of the Patriots' alleged cheating. It occurred on a pivotal fourth-and-1 play with the Patriots ahead 3-0 midway through the first quarter. After third down, Bettis said that the Patriots called a timeout after they saw the Steelers' hand signal from their sideline. Bettis said that the Patriots knew the meaning of the signal, which was a counter run.\nAfter calling the timeout, Bettis noticed that nose tackle Ted Washington went back to the Patriots' sideline, which further added to his belief that New England knew Pittsburgh's signals.\n\"Who normally goes to the sideline on a timeout? The defensive tackles right? They told the nose guard, Washington, they pulled him to the sideline,\" Bettis said. \"Big 400-pound guy, he doesn't wanna go the sideline and go all the way back. What does he want to go to the sideline for? They're yelling, making him go the sideline and come back.\n\"Then, we run the play, he loops into the hole, Washington does, they stop us on fourth down. That's a critical play in the game. They had our signs, and they called a timeout to get them ready for that play because they knew it was coming. No question in my mind. I remember vividly, I thought, 'Why is this big dude going to the sideline?' But I'm not mad about that.\"\nAs Bettis alluded to, the Patriots stuffed the play, then capitalized on the stop one play later when Tom Brady hit Deion Branch for a 60-yard score. The lead swelled to 24-3 before the Steelers began a modest comeback that ultimately fell short. New England won 41-27, then successfully defended its title with a 24-21 win over the Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX.\nBettis ultimately chose to return in 2005, and he was rewarded after Roethlisberger made good on his promise to get him to a Super Bowl. Bettis then retired on the podium after the Steelers defeated the Seahawks in Super Bowl XL.\nDespite that win, Bettis is clearly still miffed by the Patriots and the role that Spygate may have played in two of his three AFC title game losses. While we don't know how much it impacted the 2004 title game, a 2015 story by ESPN revealed that handwritten diagrams of Steelers hand signals from the 2001 season were discovered inside Patriots headquarters during the NFL's 2007 investigation that resulted in major fines as well as a loss of a first-round draft pick.\nThat is probably why several prominent Steelers are still questioning the legitimacy of the outcomes in those games. Conversely, former Steelers coach in 2020 Hall of Fame inductee Bill Cowher does not use Spygate as an excuse for his team coming up short in those games.\n\"It's only cheating if you get caught,\" Cowher said in a 2021 interview with The Athletic. \"Like any player, if you're going to hold him, don't get caught. If you get caught, you're wrong, if you don't, you're right. I always thought we never lost the games to New England because of Spygate. If [Bill Belichick] got the calls because we didn't do a very good job of making sure we signaled those in, that's on us, it's not on him. Because we're always looking for competitive edges.\n\"I think as any coach whether it's someone's stance, someone's split, someone's formation. You're looking at someone's eyes, how are they coming out of a huddle? You're always looking for those little things that give you a competitive edge and that to me is what that was.\"", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/ben-roethlisberger-jerome-bettis-accuse-patriots-of-cheating-during-2004-afc-title-game-win-over-steelers/", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2021/05/05/8915fa32-d64a-4d11-9667-320f33e793f1/thumbnail/1200x675/4ca9f7734b2492472271d83e38994ed3/bettisben.png", "publishedAt": "2023-09-26T17:09:00Z", "source": {"name": "CBS Sports", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com"}}, {"title": "Cost of living latest: Mars reduces size of popular Galaxy chocolate bar", "description": "Galaxy chocolate bars have dropped 10g per bar in the latest example of \"shrinkflation\".

Their mission is to meet - face-to-face - with about 35 million BJP supporters by January, or roughly 2,000 each. The Bharatiya Janata Party, the world's largest political outfit with 180 million members, is betting on what it says is the biggest voter outreach campaign in history, to secure a third term in power in the world's most populous country.\nIts leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, remains enduringly popular among Indians after almost a decade having brought political stability, invested in infrastructure, and championed welfare reforms and national security. Despite voter concerns about inflation, unemployment and uneven growth, opinion polls suggest the right-wing BJP will comfortably win a third term in the federal elections, expected to be held in April and May.\nIt's no sure thing, though: growing anti-incumbency sentiment is conspiring with a newly formed national alliance of 26 opposition parties, including archrival Congress, to pose what BJP officials say will be Modi's toughest test by far. \"For once we are now seeing a united opposition,\" said Tamoghna Ghosh, a senior BJP official campaigning in Kolkata. \"They may be devoid of a shared political ideology or vision, but their determination to defeat Modi can't be overlooked.\"\nWhile Modi and his party stress they govern for all Indians, their emphasis of their Hindu faith and culture has disquieted some members of minority groups who feel politically excluded, especially Muslims who make up about 14% of the 1.4 billion population. Some critics warn of an erosion of India's status as a secular democracy, long enshrined in its constitution.\nBJP leaders in New Delhi have been spurred to action by an internal report presented to them by researchers in February that concluded that an anti-incumbency vote could see the party lose about 34 of their 303 lawmakers in the lower house of parliament, robbing it of the majority that gives it a freer hand to pass laws, three senior party officials told Reuters. \"This time we will have to win in uncharted territories as retaining all the existing seats for the third time in a row is going to be a challenge,\" said BJP national president J.P. Nadda, who is leading the grassroots mobilisation drive.\nIn conversations with Reuters, Nadda and six other senior BJP figures outlined previously unreported details of the project - dubbed the \"Big Outreach\" internally - which they said marked a shift from its 2014 and 2019 election strategies focused more on large campaign rallies across the country. It won't be an easy task, or free of risk, according to Nalin Mehta, dean at the UPES School of Modern Media in Uttarakhand and author of the book \"The New BJP\". He said the ground mobilisation, accompanied by an online campaign blitz, could fuel anti-incumbency sentiment in some quarters.\n\"The BJP's challenge as the dominant national party is to manage voter fatigue and to sustain the enthusiasm among its cadres after two terms in power,\" Mehta added. \"The party's ground-level cadre-building goes hand in hand with the creation of a massive digital footprint ... as well as an industrial scale use of social media.\"\n'BJP WON'T BE THIRD-TIME LUCKY' The BJP's outreach began over the summer, much earlier than in its previous campaigns when mobilisation started about four months before national elections.\nThe campaign isn't focusing on wooing voters from rival parties, according to the party officials, but will instead make direct contact with people who voted BJP in 2019 to lock down their support, enlist their campaigning assistance and provide intelligence on local issues. The first phase, slated to end in early October, targets 134 priority constituencies with Hindu-majority populations where they lost by narrow margins in 2014 and 2019.\n\"These seats require energetic intervention and insulation of existing vote share,\" said Nadda, adding that the second phase ending in January would see activists visit all of the 303 seats that the party won four years ago. \"This time, the world's biggest party has launched the biggest-ever outreach to win the world's biggest elections.\"\nMahua Moitra, a national lawmaker with the regional opposition All India Trinamool Congress, isn't impressed. She said the bolstered outreach efforts reflected the threats posed to the BJP by the \"INDIA\" alliance of 26 rivals formed in July to challenge the ruling party's nationalist platform and oust Modi. \"The BJP is in panic mode and it's forcing them to set up a taskforce to meet voters a year before elections,\" she added. \"They won't be third-time lucky.\"\nMoitra is MP for Krishnanagar in West Bengal, a state in India's far east where Muslims make up about a quarter of the population. The BJP is resented by many voters there who fear its brand of Hindu nationalism has marginalised minorities and hindered their economic progress. Mallikarjun Kharge, president of the rival Congress party, said the coalition of 26 regional parties might not have the financial clout enjoyed by the ruling to launch a similar grassroots campaign, but the alliance had mustered a broad enough opposition base to oust Modi. \"The BJP's grassroot workers can gather intelligence or coax voters but they will not win the 2024 election,\" he said, adding that too much \"in-your-face\" campaigning could turn off voters.\nKOLKATA: CRADLE OF RENAISSANCE Not so, says BJP leader Nadda who says politicians must keep their ear to the ground.\nKolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, is a city with deep historical, strategic and political significance. Long a trading hub for commodities like jute and tea, it was once the seat of British power in India as well as the cradle of an intellectual and artistic renaissance born in the 18th century. Kolkata North, where and his group are campaigning, is a prime example of an early priority seat being targeted by the ruling party, as well as the problems the BJP faces nationally.\nThe BJP was beaten by a regional opposition party four years ago, even though it had strong support there, winning roughly 600,000 of the total 1.5 million votes cast. Nonetheless Partha Chaudhury, an ophthalmologist by profession, has a clear vision as he traverses streets dotted with the 300-year-old crumbling architectural legacy of a bygone colonial era.\nHis first stop is a tin-shed shop in a slum district skirted by Victorian-era houses that have seen better days, where introduces himself to a bare-chested shopkeeper tending a cauldron of oil and kneading dough to fry samosas. \"Please tell us, elder brother, what can we do to make your life better?\" Chaudhury asked the shopkeeper and simultaneously ticks off the man's name in his voter list.\nHe speaks fervently about a slew of reforms introduced by the federal government to improve lives of the urban poor since Modi came to power in 2014. Chaudhury intones a mantra he'll repeat to more than 20 voters in the next three hours: \"We know you vote for the BJP and we are here to understand what we should be doing to win this seat in 2024.\"\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "url": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/politics/2607777-insight-indias-bjp-the-worlds-biggest-party-plots-election-drive-of-epic-scale", "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/11_03_2020_13_22_31_2034832.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "publishedAt": "2023-09-26T03:32:02Z", "source": {"name": "Devdiscourse", "url": "https://www.devdiscourse.com"}}, {"title": "911 caller complains about Tim Hortons coffee", "description": "Officers used the example to warn residents to be more discerning when making emergency calls.", "content": "State Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Washington D.C.

A...", "content": "During the 78th session of the UN General Assembly, world leaders took to the platform to highlight numerous issues in an effort to prompt collective action to address them. A key issue once again was the Russian invasion and war in Ukraine. The war remains front page news in the West. Not only are Western states, especially NATO members, giving humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine, but they are also taking the opportunity to build a stronger narrative against Russia.\nDo other people around the world facing state violence get the same kind of help? Sadly, not. Western hypocrisy makes sure that it protects its own while leaving others at the mercies of their oppressors.\nThis is nothing new. There are many people and communities who stand as testimony to this hypocrisy. Libya, Syria, Afghanistan and Kashmir, for example, whose citizens never know if they will live another day. Children play in the ruins of their own homes while elders hide wherever they can to avoid being blown up.\nthe promoters of \u201cpeace\u201d are, all too often, the protectors of the warmongers, or warmongers themselves\nWhere is the peace that is promised so often and trumpeted as a priority by numerous countries and international organisations? The reality is that the promoters of \u201cpeace\u201d are, all too often, the protectors of the warmongers, or warmongers themselves.\nIn his speech to the General Assembly, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said that Middle East peace will not be possible until the Palestinians are granted their full rights. While that is true, why is the ongoing Israeli occupation and war in Palestine only linked to the Middle East, while the Ukraine war is a global issue? Taken one step further, we must ask why Ukraine is in the media and on politicians\u2019 lips daily, while Palestine \u2014 or Syria; or Kashmir \u2014 is only newsworthy when Israel launches a major military offensive.\nPalestinians are being killed by Israeli security forces and illegal settlers every single day; even children. The concepts of human rights and international law simply aren\u2019t applied to Israel, which is allowed to act with impunity. The \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d was tried and failed in 1947/48, when the UN Partition Plan for Palestine led to the state of Israel being declared on much more territory than was allotted for the \u201cJewish\u201d state.\nOPINION: UN Resolution 181 must be repealed: The creation of Israel and the partition of Palestine was a terrible mistake\nOnce recognised by the superpowers of the day \u2014 the USSR and US \u2014 Israel continued to push its borders outwards, taking more and more Palestinian land by force. The Palestinians ethnically-cleansed in 1948 have been supplemented by thousands of their compatriots who have been displaced over the years. Their homes are demolished by the Israeli occupation forces and they have to move. The West, meanwhile, stands by and watches, and declares any Palestinian who dares to resist such oppression \u2014 legitimately, under international law \u2014 to be a \u201cterrorist\u201d. Having conceived and given birth to the occupation state, the West makes sure that it is allowed to grow, regardless of its impact on the indigenous population of Palestine.\nThe peace process is dead and buried, and the Oslo Accords which spawned it are discredited. Israel never makes concessions; the Palestinians make too many concessions. Indeed, the Palestinians are extremely sceptical about the whole process, and rightly so. They have seen Israel take more Palestinian land and build illegal settlements for decades; they are subject to military law across the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem; and they are subjected to what is described as apartheid by the Israeli regime.\nWhen few people are ready to raise their voice for the Palestinians, and those who do are accused of anti-Semitism, it is almost impossible for anyone to trust the Others. US involvement is one-sided; Washington simply cannot be called an honest broker for peace, because it has invested too much in Israel as a state, and supports it to the tune of $3 billion of military aid every year. Peace is not a priority if that is going to affect Israel too much; the Zionist state must maintain its hegemony in the region. The more that \u201cnormalisation\u201d agreements spread \u2014 the next will be with Saudi Arabia \u2014 the more that Israel is emboldened to annex Palestine completely. That is the eye-opening harsh reality facing the Palestinians.\nThey are being backed into a corner to accept the unacceptable, with crumbs thrown from the Israeli table and the prospect of a viable, independent state disappearing over the horizon. How long can the Palestinian Authority and the people of Palestine last without international or even regional intervention to seek justice? The sad fact is that Western interests lie in maintaining the state of Israel, even at the expense of the Palestinians and the state that they have been promised for more than 75 years. Israel knows this, so it will continue to chip away at the Palestinians and their land, and nobody will do anything about it, not even those who preach peace while practising war.

But when this response escalates, for example in the brain, it can lead to serious neurological or psychiatric diseases. A team from the University of Geneva (UNIGE), the University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG), Imperial College London and Amsterdam UMC, investigated a marker protein targeted by medical imaging to visualize cerebral inflammation, but whose interpretation was still uncertain. The team reveals that a large quantity of this protein goes hand in hand with a large quantity of inflammatory cells, but its presence is not a sign of their overactivation. These results, published in Nature Communications, pave the way for optimal observation of neuroinflammatory processes and a re-reading of previous studies on the subject.\nInflammation is a natural defensive reaction initiated by the immune system. It enables our cells to fight off aggression, such as injury or infection. But this response can also get out of control and lead to the onset of serious pathologies. When it occurs in the brain - in which case it is known as neuroinflammation - this overactivation can play a part in the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis) and psychiatric diseases (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression).\nIn the brain, microglial cells play an important role in inflammation and its potential overactivation. They can be ''activated'' when dysfunction occurs, phagocytize pathological cells or proteins and even produce protective substances. Currently, in medical imaging, only one marker can be used to locate and measure microglia non-invasively and in vivo: the TSPO protein, which is present in these cells. This protein can be observed by Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a common imaging technique.\nWhat does TSPO protein reveal?\nHundreds of studies have used PET scans of this protein to explore and quantify microglia. However, no study has succeeded in precisely interpreting the significance of its quantity in the context of an inflammatory reaction.'' Stergios Tsartsalis, senior clinical associate in the Department of Psychiatry at the UNIGE Faculty of Medicine\nDoes a large quantity of TSPO correspond to a large quantity of inflammatory cells? Is it a sign of their overactivation? Together with researchers from Imperial College London (Dr David Owen) and Amsterdam UMC (Prof Sandra Amor), Stergios Tsartsalis and members of Prof Philippe Millet's team from the HUG's Laboratory of translational imaging in psychiatric neuroscience and the UNIGE's Group of molecular neuroimaging in psychiatry set out to find out.\nThe international research team worked on the brains of mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis, and on post-mortem brain samples from patients affected by the same diseases.\n''We discovered that a high density of TSPO protein is indeed an indicator of a high density of microglia. On the other hand, the observation of TSPO does not allow us to say whether or not the inflammatory cells are overactivated,'' explains the UNIGE researcher, co-first author of the study.\nRe-reading the past, optimizing the future\nThis discovery highlights the value of medical imaging of TSPO: it makes it possible to identify cases where the neuroinflammatory disease is linked to a deregulation in the number of glial cells. In addition, the scientists have identified two markers of the state of microglia activation in humans - the LCP2 and TFEC proteins - which pave the way for new medical imaging approaches.\n''These results represent a further step towards understanding the role of microglia in neuroinflammation. They will help to optimize the focus of future studies and also to review the conclusions of previous research,'' enthuses Stergios Tsartsalis. Combined with the significant development of molecular imaging at the UNIGE and the HUG, this study, supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and the Prof Dr Max Clo\u00ebtta Foundation, set the scene for effective observation of the immune mechanisms of neurological and psychiatric diseases, within the two Geneva institutions and beyond.", "url": "https://www.news-medical.net/news/20230925/Scientists-decode-the-marker-protein-that-can-be-used-to-e28098e28098seee28099e28099-neuroinflammation.aspx", "image": "https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/picture/2016/3/Artificially_Colored_MRI_Scan_Of_Human_Brain-Daisy_Daisy_a8c5d8bbbf824bc8932308e30187510f-620x480.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-09-25T16:15:00Z", "source": {"name": "News-Medical.net", "url": "https://www.news-medical.net"}}, {"title": "Future focus: Why digital wellbeing needs to be a priority for employers", "description": "Aon's Sandy Locke discusses employee engagement surveys, leading by example when it comes to tech usage and why leaders need to be more adaptable.", "content": "Aon\u2019s Sandy Locke discusses employee engagement surveys, leading by example when it comes to tech usage and why leaders need to be more adaptable.\nIt\u2019s old news now, thankfully, but the pandemic changed our attitudes to work in two big ways. The first change was we all went remote or \u2018digital first\u2019 \u2013 and some of us never went fully back into the office. The second change was in attitudes towards workplace wellbeing. Lots of us reassessed where we were in our careers and what we expected from our employers.\nA lot of soul-searching went on for employers, too, as they struggled to retain staff. Everything was moving very fast for a while, but the employment market seems to be stabilising. Talk of upskilling as a way of retaining employees and preparing for the future is a hot topic at the moment. Technology\u2019s role in helping companies and workers upskill for an uncertain future has not gone unnoticed. However, as we leap from the pandemic into a brave new accelerated tech world filled with generative AI and all sorts of advancements, some warn that we should not let workplace wellbeing fall by the wayside in our haste to embrace new tech.\nHuge shift in expectations\nSandy Locke, chief people officer for Aon\u2019s Reinsurance, Human Capital Solutions and Strategy and Technology Group, has noticed that there has been \u201ca huge shift\u201d in employees\u2019 expectations of their employers regarding workplace wellbeing. She advocates something called \u2018digital wellbeing\u2019, or a way of leveraging tech to boost people\u2019s happiness at work.\n\u201cPre-pandemic, wellbeing was an emerging trend but Covid was certainly an accelerator that magnified the importance of our employees being \u2018well\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is all-encompassing, covering physical and mental health, as well as financial health and preventative wellness trends.\u201d\nLocke is well-placed to make these observations; before she joined Aon in her current role in 2022, she held numerous leadership and HR-adjacent roles with various organisations in financial services and consulting. She tells SiliconRepublic.com that her \u201centire career has been centred around change management\u201d.\nSo, what does she think about workplace wellbeing, and more importantly, does she have any advice for employers? \u201cEmployers must adjust to address their employees\u2019 increased expectations. Instead of merely surviving, employees want to thrive at their jobs. People leaders need to consider how to create the right \u2018contract\u2019 for success.\u201d\nShe points out that at Aon, the exec team has hired a chief wellbeing officer \u2013 Rachel Fellowes, who spoke to us last year \u2013 to help support its global network of staff. Not every company can afford to pump such massive amounts of money into wellbeing programmes for staff, though. Aon has around 50,000 employees.\nDigital wellbeing is vital for remote employees\nFor companies that don\u2019t have such large budgets or as many employees, Locke says they need to consider how technology can help improve staff wellbeing. Yes, it can cause burnout and an \u2018always-on\u2019 culture, but that is if it is leveraged badly. It is up to leaders to align how their business uses tech tools to what their employees\u2019 expectations and professional goals are, says Locke.\nDigital tools can be used to keep workers connected when they are not in the office. Leaders can also use digital tools to gain insight into what employees want. Online surveys at various points of the year can be useful for keeping track of people\u2019s concerns and what they think could be improved. Locke is a big advocate of surveys. \u201cEngagement surveys are becoming more relevant, timely and connected to what truly matters to our employees.\n\u201cAI can pick up sentiment and it will be fascinating to see how companies use this information to understand the underlying concerns. There are many tools that are disruptors to the way we have traditionally received information from our employees.\u201d\nLocke says she hopes that mobile and e-learning tools can be used to address things like resiliency and future skills.

I don't think there was anybody in the news media who said, 'Wait a second. I may not like this guy, but he has a right to interview anyone he wants, and we have a right to hear what Putin says.'\n\"You're not allowed to hear Putin's voice. Because why? There was no vote on it. No one asked me. I'm 54 years old. I've paid my taxes and followed the law,\" he said.\nIt is unclear which arm of the U.S. government Carlson claims blocked the interview.

He did not say which branch of the government allegedly did so. Scott Olson/Contributor/Getty Images\nKremlin propagandist Margarita Simonyan said in August that Carlson requested to interview Putin, but his recent comments mark the first time he has publicly acknowledged making such a request. When Newsweek previously reached out to him for confirmation, he did not respond.\nThe editor-in-chief of the Russian state media organization RT described Carlson as \"doing a great job,\" adding at the time: \"It would be great if someone hears this and gets [his] message to the president.\"\nSince leaving Fox News to set up his own show on X, formerly Twitter, Carlson has been described as playing the role of the \"useful idiot\" for Kremlin propagandists by experts, regularly being cited on Russian state media when his espoused views appear to align with theirs.\nIn late August, Russian state TV host Vladimir Solovyov told his Russia-1 audience that Carlson was a \"dead man walking\" for saying that the U.S. and Russia would go to war in the next year\u2014a war Carlson predicted America would lose.\nDmitry Kiselyov, an appointee of Putin who in 2014 said Russia could turn the U.S. \"into radioactive dust,\" repeated Carlson's comments again, visibly taking glee in the former Fox anchor's claims that Ukraine \"would crumble\" without NATO support.\nWhile Kiselyov described him as \"a highly qualified journalist,\" in July, Carlson was criticized by a U.S.-based Orthodox Christian group for \"spout[ing] Russian propaganda\" about unfounded claims of the persecution of Christians in Ukraine.\nJoanna Szostek, a scholar in Russian disinformation at the University of Glasgow in the U.K., previously told Newsweek that it was common practice for Russian state media to use sympathetic views from western commentators \"in an attempt to make the Russian propaganda appear more persuasive, as well as to suggest divisions in Western political circles (and where possible, to suggest that Western countries are not really democratic, that critics are suppressed, etc.).\"\nAsked about why he felt the state of the media was \"so miserable\" in the Die Weltwoche interview, Carlson said: \"If you want to subvert a democracy, you need to control the information that citizens receive. I'd argue that the news media in democracies is far less trustworthy than it is in other countries simply because it matters more in a democracy.\"\nHe went on to say: \"There has been a very aggressive attempt, over a number of decades on the part of the people who run the United States, to control what's available on our news stations and in our newspapers\u2014to control the news media.

As we navigate the challenging path ahead, let us draw strength from the commitment made at the G20 Leaders' Summit in September 2023. It is there that our collective resolve was reaffirmed, and our dedication to accelerating SDG implementation was made clear,\" Kamboj said.\nThe event was hosted by the Observer Research Foundation (ORF) in collaboration with the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations, United Nations India and the Reliance Foundation. In her address, Kamboj noted with concern that the SDG Progress Report shows that just 12 per cent of the Sustainable Development Goal targets are on track, progress on 50 per cent is weak and insufficient and ''worst of all, the world has stalled or gone into reverse on more than 30 per cent of the SDGs.\" Kamboj said the number of people living in extreme poverty today is higher than it was four years ago and on current trends, only 30 per cent of all countries will achieve SDG 1 of no poverty by 2030.\nHowever, India's performance on SDG 1 of no poverty is a testament to its resolve. \"India has remained committed to the cause. We are on track to reduce multidimensional poverty by at least half, much ahead of 2030,\" she said.\nKamboj said the G20 summit put SDGs front and centre underscoring the urgency in this 'Decade of Action'.\n\"This landmark event marked a turning point, where global leaders recognised the urgency of our mission and committed to accelerating implementation under the G20 2023 Action Plan\", which will achieve transformative impact on achieving the SDGs- including digital transformation; gender equality and empowerment of women; and implementing sustainable, inclusive and just transition globally.\nORF President Samir Saran said the Global South in many ways today reflects a \"new urge and a new determination by a new set of actors to carve the rules for the world.\" Later at a ministerial event 'South Rising: Partnerships, Institutions and Ideas' organised by ORF and attended by External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar, Saran said that at the New Delhi G20 summit in 2023, \"a new body is being born that will serve the seven billion people who had been invisibilised by the one billion who benefited from globalisation.\" He added that there is also a responsibility on the Global South today to no longer be acceptors of rules written by others \"but to actually be scripting them by themselves in partnership with actors who have been through this journey before, but also with those who are going to be increasingly influential in the days ahead.\" UN Resident Coordinator in India Shombi Sharp said as world leaders gathered for the high-level UNGA session, the week has been ''filled with a lot of frankly depressing news everywhere we look.\n''It's crisis, it's war, it's poverty. It's the inability of the world to come together and to put money behind the words and all of this against the backdrop of the triple planetary crisis - biodiversity loss, pollution, climate change.\" He added that amid this, there are two very important reasons to be \"optimistic\", noting that \"we know what to do\" since the SDGs remain \"our best blueprint.\" \"Secondly, we have a new engine in the room. And that is India, increasingly showing robust leadership on how to achieve the SDGs\" across so many areas including poverty reduction, digital leapfrogging and women-led development.\n\"We estimate that with the greatest youth generation in history, 1/6th of humanity, that literally 1/3rd to upwards of one-half of the SDG targets will need to be met in India.\" Sharp cited remarks by UN Secretary-General Antonio during his recent visit to India for the G20 Summit that India is the country that can make the SDGs a reality.\nIncreasingly, India is having an important impact on the rest of the SDG targets outside the country.\n\"The shining example that we're still basking in the glow from is the Indian G20 presidency and the consensus New Delhi declaration, bringing much-needed important momentum across a range of critical issues - from climate change, climate action to gender equality, to reforming multilateral institutions and international financial architecture that were designed in the aftermath of the Second World War to be fit for the new reality, the new world order and to look to see how we can achieve 2030'' agenda, Sharp said.\nReliance Foundation CEO Jagannatha Kumar said India is going through remarkable economic and technological growth and a lot of growth has also been led by the technological innovations that India has been pioneering over the last several years.\n\"Its development journey and innovative bottom-up approaches to achieving the SDGs offer exemplary models that can be replicated in other countries,\" Kumar said.\nHe added that the G20 declaration adopted by consensus at the Leaders' Summit in Delhi aptly recommends and recommits to achieving the SDGs as they saw setbacks on account of various global crisis in recent years.\nOn the occasion, a special report 'Ideas, Innovation, Implementation: India's Journey towards the SDGs' was launched that highlights 17 Indian lighthouse case studies undertaken by non-profit organisations and communities.\nPresident of Global Development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Christopher Elias said that India has completed a very successful G20 Summit ''at a time when I think only India could have pulled off such success in a year of complicated geopolitics and in a fraught situation in many parts of the world.\" The G20 Summit delivered a declaration that places development, equality and prosperity for everyone at the very center of the discussion.\n\"India is undergoing a significant multifaceted socio-economic transformation. Achievements in the areas of financial inclusion, affordable housing, access to sanitation, hygiene, piped drinking water, and electricity are very impressive. The scale of transformation is actually truly inspiring and provides valuable blueprints for the rest of the world,\" he said.\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "url": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/2606477-indias-journey-towards-sdgs-serves-as-inspiring-example-of-determination-ingenuity-amb-kamboj", "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_08_19_05616.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "publishedAt": "2023-09-25T03:41:47Z", "source": {"name": "Devdiscourse", "url": "https://www.devdiscourse.com"}}, {"title": "\"It is still a world of double standards\": EAM Jaishankar takes dig at \u2018dominant\u2019 nations", "description": "Citing the example of the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister also stressed that \"it is still a world of double standards.\"", "content": "By Ayushi Agarwal External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar while speaking on Saturday evening during an event here at 'South Rising: Partnerships, Institutions and Ideas', said that economically dominant countries are leveraging production capabilities and those countries who have institutional influence have weaponized these capabilities.\nFurther, citing the example of the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister also stressed that \"it is still a world of double standards.\" \"There is a growing sentiment in the world and the Global South in a way embodies it.

Speaking about the Global South and India's G20 Presidency, Jaishankar highlighted how India was 'the voice of the Global South' and how it steered the global conversation back to global growth and development issues by getting the G20 to talk about what the world wanted to talk about, the real problem of the G20.\n\"To get the G20, to talk about what the world wanted to talk about, that was the real problem with the G20. Our Prime Minister put it very well, he said first let's talk to the people who are not going to be on the table. Let's find out what they have to say. This is why, we were the voice of the Global South. I think it gave us the basis to say, look we have spoken to 125 countries and this is really what is troubling them and that is why we need to focus on this issue\", said Jaishankar. \"I think there's clearly a sense of history. There is much of the Global South coming from a world that was colonized. There is a sense of geography. Not all countries in the South are part of the Global South. And, I think there's also the mindset. So, the Global South is an expression, in a way, of a certain solidarity and generosity and sort of a sharing spirit community. I think if you're part of the Global South, you know it,\" he added.\nTalking further, the Minister also said that the Global South ate less wheat and more millets. \"In the name of the market a lot of things are done, like in the name of freedom a lot of things are done,\" said EAM Jaishankar.\nIn his Europe's mindset comment from last year, where he said that \"Europe's problems are the world's problems but the world's problems are not Europe's problems\", EAM Jaishankar said that \"particular statement had a particular context\" while also listing five big problems which is troubling the entire world. \"That particular statement had a particular context. If you look at what happened at the G20, part of the challenge in the G20 was actually to get the G20 to focus on, I mean anybody who travels around the world will tell you, list five big problems which are troubling the entire world. People will say debt, SDG resourcing, climate action resourcing, digital access, and I would say it could be nutrition, gender,\" said EAM Jaishankar.\n\"If you look between SDGs redevelopment, woman-led development, the digital public infrastructure, these are actually going to be the issues determined to the global progress of the next decade. Why I said this, I must also recognise, at the G20, that slot of European countries and other G20 nations, you know once you kind of reason with them and focus on them, I think everybody came on board. So, it took a country or a set of countries really to make that effort and bring the global conversation back on track,\" he added. Referring to the full consensus achieved by the New Delhi Declaration, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said that many people were surprised when India was able to get everybody together.\n\"On the G20 Summit, a lot of folks were still surprised that we actually got everybody together. I don't think they completely expected that. So there will be one set of people who are still wondering how that happened\", said EAM. \"The other part, which I think includes some people with me here now has appreciated that we got the G20 to focus on the Global South and that the job for which the G20 was created, which was global growth and development, we got them to refocus on it and with particular attention to the Global South. We did that partly by organizing a Global South summit in advance,\" he added.

A date for another council vote on the bylaw has yet to be set.\nAfter Tuesday's meeting, the Canadian Drug Policy Coalition and Pivot Legal society sent the proposed bylaw amendments to the UN's rapporteurs on the right to adequate housing and extreme poverty.

At Tuesday's meeting, city staff said council will have a revised proposal for the bylaws by the end of the calendar year.\nWhen introduced, the proposed bylaw amendments also appeared to make it illegal for charitable organizations to provide supplies to unhoused people on city property. CBC Toronto asked Nuttall if there would still be restrictions on what charities do in the revised bylaw amendment proposals. Nuttall did not respond prior to publication.\nAdvocates want amendments rescinded entirely\nThe coalition's report to the UN was endorsed by Barrie Housing and Homelessness Justice Network, of which Michael Speers is a member. He says they'd ultimately like to see the proposed bylaw amendments rescinded.\n\"If they're determined to to go ahead with some type of bylaw [amendment], if they want to modernize the language, then we will be happy to submit language that is written through a human human rights lens,\" he said.\nSpeers was also critical of the city's current approach to the homelessness issue.\n\"They don't want to provide any real solutions that lift people up, they want to basically push people out,\" he said.\nMichael Speers wants the city to rescind its proposed amendments instead of revising their language.

He was born in 1864 and learned the faith above all from his mother, as he recounted, \u201cMy mother taught me virtue from the cradle, made me grow in the knowledge of God and gave me charity as my guide.\u201d Let\u2019s be attentive: it is the mothers who pass on the faith. The faith is passed on in dialect, that is, the language of mothers, that dialect that mothers know to speak with their children. [...] Truly, charity was the north star that oriented the existence of Blessed Jos\u00e9 Gregorio: a good and sunny person with a cheerful disposition, he was endowed with a marked intelligence; he became a doctor, university professor, and scientist. But he was first and foremost a doctor close to the weakest, so much so that he was known in his homeland as \u201cthe doctor of the poor.\u201d He cared for the poor, always. To the riches of money he preferred the riches of the Gospel, spending his existence to aid the needy. In the poor, the sick, the migrants, the suffering, Jos\u00e9 Gregorio saw Jesus. The success he never sought in the world he received, and continues to receive, from the people, who call him \u201csaint of the people,\u201d \u201capostle of charity,\u201d \u201cmissionary of hope.\u201d Beautiful names: \u201csaint of the people\u201d, \u201capostle of the people\u201d, \u201cmissionary of hope\u201d.\nJos\u00e9 Gregorio was a humble man, kind, and helpful. And at the same time he was driven by an inner fire, a desire to live in the service of God and neighbor. Driven by this ardour, he tried several times to become a religious and a priest, but various health problems prevented him from doing so. Physical frailty did not, however, lead him to close in on himself, but to become a doctor who was even more sensitive to the needs of others; he clung to Providence and, forged in his soul, went ever more toward what was essential. [...] And so the Blessed understood that, through caring for the sick, he would put God\u2019s will into practice, comforting the suffering, giving hope to the poor, witnessing to the faith not in words but by example [...] How important it is not to suffer things passively, but, as Scripture says, to do everything in a good spirit, to serve the Lord (cf. Col. 3:23) [...]\nAnd in contact with Jesus, who offers himself on the altar for all, Jos\u00e9 Gregory felt called to offer his life for peace. The first World War was under way. So, we come to June 29th, 1919: a friend comes to visit him and finds him very happy. Jos\u00e9 Gregorio has indeed learned that the treaty ending the war has been signed. His offering has been accepted, and it is as if he foresees that his work on earth is done. That morning, as usual, he had been at Mass, and now he goes down the street to bring medicine to a sick person. But as he crosses the road, he is hit by a vehicle; taken to the hospital, he dies pronouncing the name of Our Lady. So, his earthly journey ends, on a road while doing a work of mercy, and in a hospital, where he had made his work a masterpiece, as a doctor.\nBrothers, sisters, in the presence of this witness let us ask ourselves: do I, faced with God present in the poor near me, faced with those in the world who suffer the most, how do I react? And the example of Jos\u00e9 Gregorio: how does it affect me? He spurs us to engagement in the face of the great social, economic, and political issues of today. So many people talk about it, so many complain about it, so many criticise and say that everything is going wrong. But that\u2019s not what the Christian is called to do; instead, he is called to deal with it, to get his or her hands dirty: first of all, as St. Paul told us, to pray (cf. 1 Tim 2:1-4), and then not to engage in idle chattering \u2013 idle chatter is a plague \u2013 but to promote good, and to build peace and justice in truth.\nREAD MORE\n(From an address on September 13th in Rome)", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2023/09/23/may-we-actively-engage-for-a-just-and-more-peaceful-world/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/ivijobP616garn1sDjvVUcVAqPk=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(1157x591:1167x601)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/UMJJ6RYRXVFQVCH7WKPZVWTIAE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-09-23T09:00:00Z", "source": {"name": "The Irish Times", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com"}}, {"title": "Savarkar's Hindu Mahasabha wrote a constitution that treated Hindus and Muslims as equals", "description": "This document is the only known example of an avowedly Hindu party setting forth its own constitutional ideas in concrete form.", "content": "Going forward, this debate will take many twists and turns.

Ambedkar, the Chairperson of the Drafting Committee. Underlying their opposition is a fear that this is part of a larger design to establish a constitutional Hindu Rashtra by undoing equal citizenship and minority protections that Ambedkar and his fellow constitutional draftsmen had painstakingly incorporated.\nDo we need a new Constitution? Lately, there has been much talk about that in India to go along with a new name for the country. The battle lines have been drawn \u2014 supporters of the proposition have pointed to how dated some of current Constitution\u2019s provisions appear.

The Mahasabha was a party led by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. Savarkar\u2019s book Essentials of Hindutva shaped the party\u2019s ideological line\u2014only those who considered the land between the Sindhu and the Sindhu Sagar both their pitribhumi (fatherland-where one\u2019s ancestors came from) and punyabhumi (holy land) could form the common brotherhood of Hindus. By definition, this included Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and atheists and excluded Muslims, Christians, Jews. And despite some internal reservations, Savarkar himself had Zoroastrians as well.\nBut this exclusionary dogma was kept aside when drafting the Constitution. Written by four men, DV Gokhale, Laxman Bhopatkar, KV Kelkar and MR Dharmadhere, with a foreword by N.C. Kelkar, this is the only known example of an avowedly Hindu party setting forth its own constitutional ideas in concrete form.\nThe ideas in this Constitution were directly inspired by Savarkar\u2019s speech at the Mahasabha session in Calcutta in 1939, where he outlined his views on the future constitution of India.\nThe contents of the CHFS, a fleshed-out version of that speech, might come as a surprise to many.\nAlso read: BJP bringing legislations opposition can\u2019t afford to stall. Ayodhya, GST, women\u2019s Bill, EWS\nWe, the people of Hindustan\nThe CHFS consisted of 111 articles and was much shorter than the eventual Constitution of India. Like the Constitution, it derived its legitimacy from the people and claimed to speak in their name. Unlike our Constitution, however, this draft placed much greater faith in principles of direct democracy. The framers of the CHFS believed that democracy in India had evolved to such a stage that people were entitled to \u201ca direct voice in respect of their social and economic well-being and political destiny.\u201d It thus made provisions for:\nInitiative \u2013 This was an innovative proposal by which citizens of the country could directly initiate legislation or constitutional amendments.

One-tenth of the voters in a constituency would have to propose such a motion and it could lead to a representative being fired if a majority voted in its\nTo the framers of the Indian Constitution, these ideas were too radical. India had to be gently guided towards democracy and not thrust into it, as these proposals were attempting. Like much else in our present Constitution, the framers wisely decided to take things slowly and ignore these proposals.\nAlso read: Why India won\u2019t see women\u2019s reservation in effect until 2039\u2014it\u2019s about trickery\nNeither India nor Bharat\nThe framers of the CHFS dwelt only briefly on the name for the country. \u201cIndia\u201d for them was \u201ca meaningless term\u201d and there was \u201cabsolutely no warrant in the past history of this country for styling it as India (sic)\u201d. The present alternative \u201cBharat\u201d was not discussed at all, despite copious references to the term in Sanskrit as well as several Indian languages. For Savarkar, Bharatavarsha, despite originating in the Vishnu Purana, was a suppression of \u201cour cradle name \u201cSindhus or Hindus\u201d. As a result, \u201cHindustan\u201d was chosen in the Constitution without any dissenting voices.\nAttached to the Indic term \u201cHindustan\u201d was a distinctly un-Indic suffix \u201cFree State\u201d to give the country its full name\u2014Hindustan Free State. In fact, the phrase was taken from Ireland, where the Irish Free State had successfully managed to free itself from colonial rule. The framers saw no contradiction in an indigenous name with a borrowed suffix. This was a recurring theme of the entire drafting process of the CHFS. As a matter of rhetoric, the CHFS was presented as the product of native Indian thought. But on matters of substance, they liberally borrowed from constitutions around the world.\nEqually, they adopted the standard Anglo-American constitutional model of a government based on separation of powers with the legislature, executive and the judiciary checking and balancing each other. More indigenous ideas of panchayats and local councils, with a focus on moral rights and wrongs rather than checks and balances, were scarcely discussed. An independent Hindustan would take the best the world had to offer.\nAlso read: Udhayanidhi\u2019s \u2018eradicate Sanatana\u2019 not a call to genocide. It\u2019s internal critique of Hinduism\nA secular State, no State religion\nPerhaps the most surprising aspect of this constitutional framework was a ringing endorsement of India\u2019s secular nature. Article 7(xv) of the CHFS provided that the Hindustan Free State would have no State religion. The possibility of a constitutional Hindu Rashtra was firmly shut.\nArticle 7(xi) gave every citizen the freedom to practice and profess their own religion and protect their own culture and language. There was no constitutional mandate to homogenise the nation. Equally, Articles 6 and 7(i) and (ii) guaranteed equal citizenship to all citizens with equal civic rights. No law could treat Hindus and Muslims differently.\nThere were clear political compulsions underlying these provisions. The Hindu Mahasabha had come into the political mainstream by forming a coalition government in Bengal during the Second World War. But after exiting that government, the Mahasabha became a fringe player in national politics. The Muslim League was on the rise and the RSS was fast emerging as the principal organiser of the Hindu community. The Congress was of course the centre of nationalist efforts. To remain relevant, the Hindu Mahasabha chose to be balanced and reasonable. The CHFS reflects that choice.\nWhile history can never serve as an assurance for the future, it can certainly be a guide. With the fortunes of parties that belong to the Sangh Parivar now firmly in the ascendant, they would do well to look to their predecessors and the spirit that animated their constitutional thought while drafting the CHFS. That spirit was one of inclusion over ideology. Hindustan would be a country that every person irrespective of religious denomination could call home. The Constitution would reflect that broad-mindedness without being hemmed in by the narrow currents of parochialism or polarisation.\nOpponents of the Sangh Parivar too ought to take note of the CHFS. Calls to draft a new constitution cannot automatically be conflated with creating a Hindu Rashtra. As Babasaheb Ambedkar himself said, quoting Thomas Jefferson, every generation should be free to debate its own constitutional ideas.\nIndia today should be no exception.\nArghya Sengupta is the author of \u2018The Colonial Constitution\u2019 published by Juggernaut.

For example, if you suspect a market downturn, you can increase your cash position.", "content": "The key to handling volatility is changing your asset mix. For example, if you suspect a market downturn, you can increase your cash position.\nYou can weather volatility better by changing the asset mix of your portfolio. For instance, if you suspect the market is fully valued, you might increase your cash position and place more money in high interest savings accounts or Guaranteed Investment Certificates.\nYou won\u2019t experience any volatility for your cash investments. Typically, they should cater to your short- to medium-term cash needs. It\u2019s also smart to have a few thousand dollars of emergency funds handy so that during an emergency, you won\u2019t have to dip into your long-term investments and potentially sell at a loss.\nBonds and preferred shares also tend to experience lower volatility than common stocks. Having a portion of your diversified portfolio in these investments can also help you weather volatility. Bonds and preferred stocks are sensitive to changing interest rates. Companies must also pay the coupons or dividends for them before they pay dividends for the common stock.\nWhat about controlling volatility in your common stock portfolio?\nThe first step is to consider stocks from different industries that are exposed to different risks. The idea is to hold a portfolio of quality stocks that aren\u2019t correlated. You\u2019ll find that stocks in the same industries often move in tandem because they\u2019re exposed to similar risks. So, it doesn\u2019t provide much diversification when you add stocks in the same industries.\nYou might choose the top one or two stocks from key industries or sectors, including a bank, utility, or telecom. Also, don\u2019t forget these sectors: technology, healthcare, consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and real estate. Furthermore, target them at good valuations.\nDividend stocks can also limit the volatility in your portfolio. For instance, stocks that pay decent dividend yields and increase their dividends over time have a bigger base of long-term investors that might help to limit the stock volatility.\nYou can also target low-beta stocks. Yahoo Finance shows the five-month beta of a stock. A beta of one implies similar volatility as the TSX. A beta lower than one implies lower volatility than the market.\nGold stock example\nFranco-Nevada (TSX:FNV) stock has a recent beta of 0.6. It is a gold-focused royalty and streaming company that has a large and diversified portfolio of cash flow-producing assets. For example, 79% of its second-quarter revenues came from precious metals \u2014 primarily gold, followed by silver. It also has streams from oil and gas.\nFranco-Nevada stock can serve as a low-risk gold investment that hedges against market volatility. It has also crushed market returns in the long run. For example, in the last 10 years, the gold stock delivered annualized returns of 16.8% versus the market returns of about 8.3%.\nIts portfolio currently consists of about 116 producing assets, while 42 projects are in advanced stages and 272 projects are in the exploration stage. Therefore, Franco-Nevada appears to have plenty of growth opportunities. Notably, the gold stock has also increased its dividend for about 15 consecutive years with a solid 10-year dividend-growth rate of 9.0%.\nAt under $189 per share at writing, it offers a dividend yield of under 1%, and analysts believe it trades at a slight discount of about 11%.", "url": "https://www.fool.ca/2023/09/22/weathering-volatility-strategies-for-success-with-tsx-stocks/", "image": "https://www.fool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Volatile-market-stock-volatility.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T20:45:00Z", "source": {"name": "The Motley Fool Canada", "url": "https://www.fool.ca"}}, {"title": "Black Sea Fleet: Ukraine has Russian targets in Crimea in its sights.

Local authorities played down the incident, saying that a number of drones were brought down. But the Ukrainian military says it successfully hit a Russian command post near Verkhniosadove, a few kilometers from Sevastopol.\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) noted that satellite imagery confirmed that Ukrainian forces \u201cstruck the 744th Communications Center of the Command of the Black Sea Fleet\u2026 as part of an apparent Ukrainian effort to target Black Sea Fleet facilities.\u201d\nFootage shows smoke following a missile attack in Sevastopol.

Joseph Richter/X\nRussia\u2019s Ministry of Defense said a Russian soldier was missing after Friday\u2019s missile attack on the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol.\n\u201cWhile repelling a missile attack, five missiles were shot down by air defense systems. As a result of the attack, the historical headquarters building of the Black Sea Fleet was damaged,\u201d the ministry said.\nUkrainian Defense Intelligence spokesperson Andrii Yusov said Russia was using Crimea as a \u201clogistics hub\u201d and that \u201cthe ultimate goal, of course, is the de-occupation of Ukrainian Crimea.\u201d\nLast month, Ukraine\u2019s special forces carried out a commando raid on the Crimean coast. The seizure earlier this month of oil platforms in the Black Sea by Ukrainian commandos has given them another jumping-off point and affected the Russian Black Sea fleet\u2019s freedom of navigation.\nThe platforms, known as the Boyko Towers, had been controlled by Russia since soon after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014.\nThere are plenty of reasons for Ukraine to target Crimea. It\u2019s politically a sign that despite the slow progress on the front lines in its counteroffensive, Ukraine can still inflict serious damage on the Russian military. Targets such as the Crimea bridge have considerable symbolic value as well as strategic purpose.\nIt\u2019s also part of a broader effort \u2013 in Crimea, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk \u2013 to hit Russian logistics, fuel, maintenance and command centers, in order to disrupt their ability to supply the front lines.\nThe Russian Black Sea Fleet has been involved in hundreds of cruise missile attacks against Ukraine and threatens merchant shipping using Ukrainian ports. Any disruption to its operation and command facilities (as well as the targeting of vessels at sea and in dock) is a win, especially after the Russian withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative in July. And, this week, the Ukrainians went after a drone facility in Crimea. Russia has used drones to target Ukraine\u2019s Danube River ports.\nUkraine has devoted considerable effort to degrading Russian air defenses in Crimea. That effort now appears to be paying off \u2013 as Ukrainian Neptune missiles (and most probably UK-provided Storm Shadows) are capable of reaching targets deep inside Crimea.\nThis image taken from UGC video, uploaded to Telegram with a watermark, shows smoke rising from the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Telegram/AP\nThe Ukrainians appear also to have rejected or ignored criticism from some US officials of their concentration on Crimea. One unnamed senior US defense official told CNN recently that \u201cit\u2019s knocked the Russians off balance a bit, but it is not doing anything decisive\u2026 And it would probably be better for everyone for them to just focus on the counteroffensive.\u201d\nThe Ukrainians argue with some justification that targeting anything to do with the Black Sea Fleet is worthwhile. As the ISW noted Thursday, \u201celements of the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s 810th Naval Infantry Brigade are engaged in critical defensive operations in western Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s 22nd Army Corps is defending positions on the east bank of Kherson Oblast.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth remembering that the Black Sea Fleet\u2019s control of the Saky airfield gives it charge of ground-based aircraft in addition to its naval-based assets.\nThe Black Sea Fleet is still a powerful element of Russia\u2019s offensive capability, but becoming less so by the week.\n\u201cThe Black Sea Fleet is more than its naval assets, and the Ukrainian attacks on the Black Sea Fleet will likely achieve effects beyond the degradation of Russian naval capabilities,\u201d concludes the ISW.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/22/europe/ukraine-crimea-russia-black-sea-intl-cmd/index.html", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230922133446-02-sevastopol-smoke-092223.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "publishedAt": "2023-09-22T15:52:43Z", "source": {"name": "Cable News Network", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com"}}, {"title": "'Shah Rukh Khan has made films that have moved generations, was offered Rs 300 crore for Mr India 2'", "description": "The filmmaker, while interacting with a fan on X, pointed out the importance of making films that last for generations, citing the example of the 'Jawan' star", "content": "Filmmaker Shekhar Kapur, known for films like Masoom, Mr India, Bandit Queen, has revealed he was offered Rs 300 crore to make a sequel to Anil Kapoor and Sridevi\u2019s Mr India.

The beat author Jack Kerouac, also a denizen of Little Canada, was an altar boy there; he called it \u201cthe ponderous chartreuse cathedral of the slums.\u201d Gargiulo\u2019s poignant book \u2014 the 2023 selection for the citywide Lowell Reads program \u2014 recounts the slow hollowing out of the neighborhood, the fires, the rumors, the mysterious relocation of families in the night.\nAdvertisement\nThe book is largely written in the voice of Gargiulo\u2019s 13-year-old self: angry, frightened, and powerless to save his home, his friends, and his beloved Aunt Rose Perrault from the ravages of so-called progress. \u201cWho was this \u2018urban renewal?\u2019 \u201d Gargiulo recalled thinking in a recent interview. \u201cIt made me even angrier; you can\u2019t punch \u2018urban renewal\u2019 in the face.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nBut this is also a story of Gargiulo\u2019s political awakening, born of the trauma of losing his home to a faceless bureaucracy. Gargiulo turned his pain into organizing, cofounding the Coalition for a Better Acre in 1982. The Acre was a poor community abutting the former Little Canada, populated largely by migrants from Latin America. And it, too, was in the sights of developers, who saw gold in the atmospheric industrial canals and abandoned textile mills.\nGargiulo was determined that the Acre wouldn\u2019t become another urban renewal tragedy. \u201cWe had to organize people to stand up and fight for their rights like we weren\u2019t able to do in Little Canada,\u201d he said. It was a way to vindicate the memory of his Aunt Rose, who was deeply damaged by being evicted from her home of 65 years.\nThe Coalition for a Better Acre focused on the North Canal Apartments, a 267-unit federal housing project that was facing \u201cexpiring use,\u201d making it eligible for conversion to market-rate housing. \u201cSuddenly it was the hottest property in Lowell,\u201d Gargiulo said. For six years the coalition, structured as a community development corporation, worked with other housing advocates, local banks, and government agencies to stop the conversion and in 1989 turned management of the property to its low-income tenants, considered the first preservation of an expiring use property in the country.\nAdvertisement\nIn a video of the press conference announcing the rescue of the project, senators Ted Kennedy and John Kerry and then-secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp bask in the limelight of this signature achievement. And there is Gargiulo, in his 1980s-era glasses, remembering his Aunt Rose and the strength he took from her to persevere in the fight. \u201cThe least I could do was never forget,\u201d he said.\nToday what was Little Canada is dominated by the University of Massachusetts Lowell campus, which didn\u2019t cause the neighborhood\u2019s destruction but benefitted from it. Recently the university installed new historic markers to document the story of the neighborhood\u2019s demise. UMass history professor Robert Forrant, who helped site the panels and leads student walking tours of the area, says institutions like the university or the National Historical Park had until recently ignored the darker aspects of the city\u2019s immigrant past. \u201cThere\u2019s a new approach to the way history is taught,\u201d he said, broadening the lens and directly involving affected communities. A good example is a new National Park exhibit commemorating Lowell\u2019s mosaic of cultures that opens Saturday.\nThese recognitions are welcome, but they lack the visceral power of Gargiulo\u2019s memoir, which wrenches the experience of urban renewal right out of dispassionate academic debate.

Photograph: Niall Carson/PA Wire\nLet\u2019s make this clear up front. I don\u2019t know any personal secrets about Bernard Looney and in an ideal world none of us would want to.\nThe Irish BP chief executive quit last week after admitting he had failed to fully disclose his past relationships with work colleagues. His resignation came after the oil company received its second anonymous complaint about Looney in the past two years.\nHis departure comes at time when staff turnover at the top of big global companies is running well above 10 per cent for the second year in a row. In the UK, 18 FTSE 100 companies are getting a new CEO this year. This is already the second-highest total since 2000 \u2013 and there are still three months to go.\nMuch of the change is planned, but personal conduct has played a larger role in forced departures since the #MeToo protests against workplace harassment took off in the late 2010s. The initial wave of firings sparked by that movement stemmed from serial rape or harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Roger Ailes and others, but it also swept out leaders who engaged in allegedly consensual relationships such as Intel\u2019s Brian Krzanich.\nREAD MORE\nThe rethink in how companies approach workplace behaviour had other prompts too. The pandemic played a part while growing numbers of younger employees now argue for greater alignment of personal and professional beliefs.\nMany employers now have much stricter rules on everything from sexual relationships to teasing and bullying, often extending to incidents outside the workplace. That shift recognises the fact that poorly handled workplace relationships, whether sexual or not, can create a culture of favouritism that silences people and saps productivity.\nThis goes all the way to the top. Last year, fully half of the forced CEO departures among the 3,000 largest US companies were due to personal misconduct, up from 14 per cent in 2017, according to the Conference Board.\nThe shift has caused some qualms. \u201cHow much should your employer be able to dive in and control your personal life?\u201d asks Alison Taylor, a New York University professor who studies business ethics. \u201cWe\u2019ve all tolerated [bad behaviour] for years but the correction opens up a lot of questions.\u201d\nTwo senior executives in different industries volunteered to me last week that they thought the ousting of Looney was due to a new wave of Anglo-American puritanism that we will one day regret. A talented chief executive who was positioning BP to lead the energy transition should not have been felled by an active personal life, they said.\nThat misses the point. Looney lost his job not because of sex but because of lies. The probe that prompted his departure marked at least the third time that the company had talked to him about personal relationships at work. Investors told the FT that the subject came up when he was appointed in 2019.\nThe first probe was opened after a complaint came in last year. The board concluded that the chief executive, who had spent his entire career at the oil group and was single for almost all of that time, had not violated company policy. Without knowing the details, it is hard to judge whether that was the right call. But BP\u2019s board did a wise thing: it asked Looney for written formal assurances that there were no further relationships or other matters that he needed to disclose.\nWhen another complaint came in with new details, Looney was sunk. The board had already made clear that the issue was about trust and there could be no next time. \u201cHe accepts that he was not fully transparent in his previous disclosures,\u201d the company said in its statement announcing his departure.\nIt is hard to understand why anyone would sign a statement promising all had been revealed when it could so quickly be called into question. But Looney is not the first chief executive to try the route of limited disclosure. In 2019, McDonald\u2019s chief executive Steve Easterbrook walked away with a severance package worth up to $40 million (\u20ac37.3 million) after he admitted to \u201cone recent consensual relationship\u201d and appealed for privacy.\nA year later, the fast-food chain sued its former chief claiming that there had been three more sexual relationships and that he had lied to the board, deleted explicit images from his work phone and approved share grants for one of the people involved. He agreed to return more than $105 million in cash and stock and paid a regulatory penalty for lying to investors.\nPerhaps the nature of a chief executive\u2019s job makes some occupants vulnerable to magical thinking, both about what they are entitled to do and what they can get away with. Deeply driven and surrounded by those who defer to their judgment, it is easy to start to believe that ordinary rules do not apply.\n\u201cGood decision making is a social activity, yet the system deifies CEOs and is designed to suppress dissent,\u201d says Roger Steare, a corporate philosopher. He argues that boards need to spend more time looking at the moral character of the people they promote and testing how potential CEOs react to personal pressure.\nBoards and executives more used to focusing on numbers and strategy may find such a shift uncomfortable. But talking about character before hiring is better than talking about sex afterwards. \u2013 Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/2023/09/21/sex-lies-and-magical-thinking-about-ceo-behaviour/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/m1Q1QS9yLPISnkfhmGgM-U5bJ4Q=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/TQ5WMK7E5C6XNQVOPOBGL7QWYE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-09-21T04:00:00Z", "source": {"name": "The Irish Times", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com"}}, {"title": "US philanthropist Buffett warns against Ukraine 'fatigue'", "description": "U.S. businessman and philanthropist Howard Buffett said on Wednesday Western public interest in the war in Ukraine could wane in the coming year, and that he may step up his own support for Ukraine to set an example.", "content": "Howard Buffett, a businessman and philanthropist, speaks during an interview with Reuters, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine September 20, 2023.

Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have banned Ukrainian grain imports.\n\"People have to understand that we're committed to Ukraine, we're not going anywhere, we're not slowing down, we'll step the pace up if that's what we have to do,\" Buffett said.\nBuffett, who has visited stricken areas of Ukraine on a series of wartime trips, said he expected his foundation's support to reach around $500 million by the end of this year.\nHis foundation has helped farmers, humanitarian mine clearance efforts, and with the distribution of generators needed for mass power cuts, pontoon bridges to replace bombed bridges, and meals and food kits along the front line.\nWestern financial and military support has been vital for Kyiv to hold its own against the army of a nuclear superpower that is the world's largest country.\nUkraine's economy shrank by about a third in 2022.

It\u2019s nearly half a million years old and provides a rare look at how ancient human relatives were working with wood and changing their environments, authors wrote in a study published Wednesday in Nature.\n\u201cIt took me a while before I appreciated what we were looking at,\u201d said study author Larry Barham, an archaeologist at the University of Liverpool. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look very nice, to be honest. But it is much more complex than I thought.\u201d\nBarham and his team dug up the log structure \u2013 plus a handful of wooden tools \u2013 from a riverbed site that sits above a waterfall in Zambia. They think the crossed logs could have been the base for a bigger structure like a walkway or a platform.\nUsually, wood rots quickly when it\u2019s exposed to the elements, which has left us with little evidence of how our ancient relatives used the material, Barham explained. But these materials were submerged in the river, which helped preserve them.\nSo when his team uncovered the logs in 2019, they were still able to see telltale signs that early humans had shaped them \u2013 carving out a notch in the upper log, tapering off the ends and leaving tool marks across the surface.\n\u201cEverything just looks so fresh, you think, `It cannot be this old,\u201d' Barham said.\nFiguring out just how old posed its own challenge, since traditional dating techniques couldn\u2019t get deep enough into the past. In this study, researchers used a new method called luminescence dating, which uses tiny minerals in the sand to estimate how long materials have been buried, explained study author Geoff Duller, an expert in dating methods at Aberystwyth University in Wales.\nThe log structure was made at least 476,000 years ago, while the wood tools are slightly younger, under 400,000 years old. That places the materials in a time before our species, Homo sapiens, evolved.\nThey would have been made by another kind of early human cousin \u2013 possibly Homo heidelbergensis, which was around in Africa at the time, authors said.\nIf these ancient humans were putting effort into \u201cthe furniture of the site,\u201d it suggests they may have stayed for a while or made repeat visits \u2013 not just roamed around as bands of hunter-gatherers, according to Dirk Leder, an archaeologist at Germany\u2019s Lower Saxony State Office for Cultural Heritage who was not involved with the research.\nAnd if \u201claying a couple of logs down doesn\u2019t sound that exciting,\u201d said Annemieke Milks, an archaeologist at the University of Reading who also was not involved in the study, consider this \u2013 it shows a different perspective from the usual stone tools that are often discovered.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important window into what these humans were capable of,\u201d Milks said.", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-researchers-uncover-simple-structure-that-may-be-oldest-example-of/", "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/FIRaUUt9M9JyWB8YJ4jxUDadT-8=/1200x800/filters:quality(80)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tgam/I6YJSFPV2NMYJNVIQJ46NXETCE.jpg", "publishedAt": "2023-09-20T15:26:26Z", "source": {"name": "The Globe and Mail", "url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com"}}, {"title": "Factoring in Washington\u2019s Longstanding Issues, Hopeful Magic Johnson Unveils Heroics of the Lakers That \u201cHealed the City\u201d", "description": "In a recent interview, 5x NBA champion and NFL co-owner Magic Johnson gives the perfect example of how sports can bring people together.", "content": "NEW YORK, NEW YORK \u2013 OCTOBER 29: Earvin \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson, Chairman and CEO of Magic Johnson Enterprises speaks onstage during ONWARD19: The Future Of Search \u2013 Day 2 at Marriott Marquis Times Square on October 29, 2019 in New York City.

However, Iceman\u2019s abilities are limited only by his creativity; Bobby gains the upper hand by freezing the air around Helium, and uses his own body to transport Helium into orbit, where the villain is left floating, more than proving just how dangerous this original X-Men member can be. While Orchis leader Nimrod may recognize Bobby Drake\u2019s true power, the rest of the organization apparently didn\u2019t get the memo.\nJean Isn't The Only Founding Member Of The X-Men With Omega-Level Powers\nIceman has served with the X-Men for as long as they\u2019ve existed, but he hasn\u2019t always been treated with the respect he deserves. Now that Jean is gone, it is clear that Iceman is the most powerful living mutant left on Earth. During Nimrod\u2019s attack on the Hellfire Gala, readers learn just how the ultimate mutant hunter classifies his prey; Jean Grey is designated Omega-One, a designation earned by her status as the X-Men\u2019s most powerful hero, while, her fellow founder Iceman is considered by Nimrod to be Omega-Two. Bobby's defeat of Helium \u2013 among countless other examples of his strength \u2013 more than makes the case for this designation.\nBobby Drake suffered his own seeming demise at Nimrod's hands during the Hellfire Gala; currently stuck in his Iceman form, he is still dependent on the powers of his lover Romeo to keep his consciousness in one piece. Even so, he still manages to single-handedly transport an incredibly dangerous foe into the atmosphere under his own power. His status as an Omega-level mutant means that the upper limit of his abilities has yet to be defined, meaning his actions against Helium are just the tip of the iceberg.

Years ago, Calcutta became Kolkata\u00a0for example and Bombay was changed to\u00a0Mumbai\u00a0in 1996. Now the biggest name change of all may be in the offing, writes Akanksha Singh.", "content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Akanksha Singh is a Mumbai-based writer whose work has appeared in the BBC, The Independent, South China Morning Post and numerous other publications. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nMumbai CNN \u2014\nIndia has changed the names of many of its towns and cities over the years. The port city and one-time capital Calcutta became Kolkata in 2001. The name of India\u2019s financial capital Bombay, was changed to Mumbai in 1996. That same year, Madras was renamed Chennai. Over the years, even some roads, railway stations and markets have been renamed. The idea, we Indians were told each time, was to allow the nation to make a clean break once and for all with its colonial past.\nAkanksha Singh Courtesy of Akanksha Singh\nNow, the most dramatic rebranding of all may be in the offing.\nEarlier this month, India hosted the G20 gathering of the world\u2019s richest nations. A dinner invitation from Indian President Droupadi Murmu described her as the \u201cPresident of Bharat,\u201d prompting rampant speculation in political and journalistic circles that a formal name change could be in the country\u2019s future.\nAs the inaugural G20 sessions got underway, suspicions heightened: The nameplate at Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s seat identifying the country he represented read \u201cBharat\u201d instead of \u201cIndia.\u201d Indian officials, meanwhile, wore badges with the words \u201cBharat Official.\u201d\nThose clues dropped at the G20 might have been a long run-up to a grand unveiling.\nVarious media outlets are reporting that the Modi government may put forward a resolution during a special session of India\u2019s parliament this week to officially change the country\u2019s name to Bharat, although no agenda has been officially announced. On Tuesday, Modi proposed a new name for the old parliament building itself, suggesting it be called Samvidhan Sadan going forward.\nThe question on the minds of many people who follow events in India, is why any name change would be needed. Bharat, which means \u201cIndia\u201d in Hindi, is already one of the country\u2019s two official names. In fact, Article 1 of the nation\u2019s constitution, reads: \u201cIndia, that is Bharat, shall be a union of states.\u201d\nWhat seems patently clear to me is that this proposed rebranding has nothing to do with stamping out the vestiges of a reviled colonial past. The goal, which has been at the forefront of the Modi government\u2019s agenda, is to erase every facet of Indian history that doesn\u2019t feed its right-wing Hindu ideology.\nIndeed, the state goal of Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government is to make India a \u201cHindu rashtra (nation).\u201d A name change to \u201cBharat\u201d would be, first and foremost, about Hindu nationalism. It\u2019s an opportunity to double down on India\u2019s Hindu identity, even in the name by which it is called. Wiping away the vestiges of British rule, is no longer the main goal, if indeed it ever was.\nSince coming to power in 2014, Modi has made life increasingly difficult for India\u2019s 200 million Muslims, the country\u2019s largest minority group, (they make up about 14% of the population) which faces discrimination in finding work and in getting an education, and who increasingly are targets of communal violence.\nSince his reelection in 2019, conditions for India\u2019s Muslims have only worsened, as the government ramps up policies that critics say attempt to divest Muslims of their rights and seeks to disenfranchise them.\nAgainst that backdrop, the name changes being carried out by the Modi government may seem a comparatively small slight, but erasure is yet another insult to an already beleaguered community. Indeed, in recent years, several towns and cities whose names reflect the Muslim empires that dominated the Indian subcontinent centuries ago have been renamed by BJP governments.\nIn 2018, the northern city of Allahabad, founded by Mughal emperor Akbar, was changed to Prayagraj. A nearby historic railway exchange, Mughalsarai Junction was renamed Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction, honoring a 20th century Hindu nationalist leader, after being scrubbed of the name Mughalsarai. The list of name changes is long and growing.\nThe decision by Modi\u2019s move to signal the name change at the G20 was curious. For months before the start of the event, officials planning the event had been referring to the host country as \u201cIndia.\u201d Perhaps the idea was to field test the new name at the G20, where the world would be watching, to gauge what international reaction would be, and to sniff out possible public disapproval within India.\nIn fact, there has been considerable opposition to changing India\u2019s name. During a recent European tour to meet with politicians and prominent members of the Indian diaspora, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi called the proposition of a name change \u201cabsurd.\u201d\nEven if Modi proposes renaming the country as Bharat, some experts say changing India\u2019s name would require a constitutional amendment and therefore two-thirds support of both houses of parliament \u2014 a heavy lift, since the opposition would be unlikely to support it. The debate is a live one, however: Some disagree, saying that no amendment to the constitution would be needed to change India\u2019s name.\nIf the measure were to succeed, there would a price to pay, as there always is for these kinds of sweeping, symbolic changes. According to some, this particular name change could cost tens of millions of dollars. Landmarks would have to be re-inscribed, maps redrawn, books reprinted.\nAnd in the event that this name change goes through, there\u2019s the question of how it is to be put into place and how far officials plan to take the name change. Does the RBI \u2013 the Reserve Bank of India \u2013 become the RBB? Do the country\u2019s Indian Institutes of Technology become BITs? Has any of this even been thought through?\nIt\u2019s an enormous expenditure of capital in what is the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, which has the world\u2019s largest population, but a per capita income that is one-quarter that of China\u2019s.\nWhat else might Modi do with those funds to improve the lives of the people of India (or Bharat, if you must)? And where else might he direct the nation\u2019s focus and energies? For starters India is roiling with rampant ethnic violence. I\u2019ve not heard Modi address the alarming spiral of violence in the northeastern state of Manipur, from where a particularly horrific sexual assault captured on video continues to shock the conscience of the nation.\nHere are some things I\u2019d address in Modi\u2019s shoes: Several activists, poets, lawyers, journalists, academics, and musicians are still in jail under a draconian \u201canti-terror\u201d law that the government exercises at its own will, without accountability or any indication of a timeline. I think that the world\u2019s largest democracy might work toward living up to the name and free or at the very least, properly prosecute those activists who have been imprisoned.\nI might also look for ways to address the country\u2019s staggeringly high unemployment rates. And perhaps the government could look for ways to address the plight of women, religious minorities and caste-based minorities remain unsafe, while its human rights record is getting worse all the time.\nThere are some hopeful signs. The United Nations and humanitarian groups have condemned New Delhi\u2019s actions against the Muslim minority, although BJP has repeatedly pushed back against criticisms, stating somewhat duplicitously that it \u201crespects all religions.\u201d\nEncouragingly, earlier this year, amid the headlong rush to rename India\u2019s towns and villages, the Supreme Court rejected a petition to rename vast numbers of historical sites, saying that the proposal went against the principle of secularism enshrined in the Constitution.\n\u201cWe are secular and supposed to protect the Constitution. You are concerned about the past and dig it up to place its burden on the present,\u201d the court ruling said.\nVery much so. And it\u2019s a message Modi and his political companions should heed.", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/20/opinions/india-name-change-modi-parliament-special-session-singh/index.html", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230919205439-narendra-modi-09182023.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "publishedAt": "2023-09-20T12:23:24Z", "source": {"name": "Cable News Network", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com"}}, {"title": "Why Modi Government Bringing in Women\u2019s Reservation Bill Was a Much-Needed Move - News18", "description": "For all too long, there has been a disconnect between the grassroots mobilisation of women by the RSS-BJP and their participation in electoral politics. It\u2019s time for the BJP to change that, and lead by the power of example", "content": "In tabling the \u2018Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam\u2019, the latest iteration of the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill, the Narendra Modi government has taken a positive step towards closing the political representation gap and sent out a message of hope at a time when women\u2019s rights are under assault in many parts of the globe.\nSignificantly, the Constitution (128th Amendment) Bill, providing a 33 per cent quota for women in the Parliament and state assemblies, was the first to be tabled in the new Parliament building. It was, perhaps, a signal that the ground had shifted and a shake-up of the political establishment was imminent!\nThe PM\u2019s empowerment initiative puts the Opposition in a tough spot, for three reasons. First, it cannot position itself on the wrong side of such an emotive issue, even though credit for the passage of the law will go entirely to the Modi government. For instance, Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha, who has been lobbying for the Bill, has no choice but to welcome it.\nSecond, the wind has been taken out of the INDIA company\u2019s \u2018democracy in danger\u2019 campaign. The government\u2019s stated commitment to furthering gender parity in political representation is eminently progressive, liberal and in keeping with the tenets of democracy. And like the government\u2019s welfare schemes, it benefits women of all castes and communities.\nThird, the women\u2019s vote is now a potent force in electoral politics. In the 2019 general elections, the gender gap was not only bridged but reversed, with 67.18 per cent of women participating as opposed to 67.01 per cent of men. For some Opposition leaders, such as Nitish Kumar and Mamata Banerjee, the women\u2019s vote is all-important. If the Bill becomes law, the BJP will have the \u2018W\u2019 factor advantage.\nThat the prime minister means business is evident from his characterisation of the Bill as an \u2018agni pareeksha (trial by fire)\u2019 for the ruling BJP. Party MPs who are privately opposed to the Bill for fear of losing their seats have been warned that they must fall in line, even if that means voting against their own self-interest. Fortunately, implementation is a long way off, so the fallout will be visible only in 2029.\nThe debate will be interesting, going by past experience. Ever since the Deve Gowda government introduced the Bill in 1996, every government has tried to push it through \u2013 in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2010. But the closest it ever came to becoming a law was its passage in the Rajya Sabha in 2010 (only to lapse thereafter).\nEach time, it was held up for lack of consensus, which goes to show that consensus is overrated at times. Opposition to the Bill came largely from OBC MPs, who felt it ought to provide a quota within a quota for certain categories. The current iteration provides reservations for SCs and STs; for obvious reasons, it cannot do so for backward castes.\nThe other argument, that the reserved seats would go to the wives, mothers, sisters or daughters of political families, has some basis. The same argument was made vis-a-vis reservation of seats for women in panchayats and local bodies (initially 33 per cent, now 50 per cent in most states) in 1993. However, despite the \u2018sarpanchpati\u2019 culture, political awareness among women has increased over time. Studies testify to the vital role played by reservation in improving the political participation of women and combatting patriarchal attitudes.\nGlobally, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) pegs the representation of women at 26.5 per cent. Only six countries have achieved or exceeded gender parity in this regard. India, with representation at 15.1 per cent, stands 140th in a list of 186 countries, behind Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. Likewise, in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Gender Gap Index, India is 127th in a list of 146 countries. If it is to improve its position, the Women\u2019s Reservation Bill must become law.\nThe fragility of women\u2019s rights became evident when the Supreme Court of the United States rolled back Roe vs Wade, which guaranteed the legal right to abortion, in June 2022. Poland, too, has severely restricted the reproductive rights of women. In Afghanistan, women have been progressively stripped of virtually all their rights. In Iran, anti-hijab protests have resulted in the government mooting a mandatory hijab law that proposes a ten-year sentence for violators.\nIndia\u2019s initiative is all the more important against this backdrop. Political parties must, however, ensure that it does not become a tokenism. On no account should women be excluded altogether from general (unreserved) seats.\nSome political parties have already made important strides in furthering the representation of women in electoral politics, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Biju Janta Dal (BJD), for example. The BJP, sadly, has not been one of them. For all too long, there has been a disconnect between the grassroots mobilisation of women by the RSS-BJP and their participation in electoral politics. It\u2019s time for the BJP to change that, and lead by the power of example.\nBhavdeep Kang is a freelance writer and author of \u2018Gurus: Stories of India\u2019s Leading Babas\u2019 and \u2018Just Transferred: The Untold Story of Ashok Khemka\u2019.

She was at least among familiar surroundings, having previously led a number of age groups in the club's academy and acted as assistant head coach.\nA club in transition also presented a pretty clear opportunity, if she could get it right. A blank slate, a chance to rebuild the club from the ground up, and without the usual morale drop of a relegation.\nThat City are already back in the big time shows how well she has done, and what a base she built in such a short timeframe.\nImage: Smith (second right) led Bristol City to the Women's Championship title last season\nSo much so that seven of the team who started her first game in charge in 2021 could be on the team sheet when Leicester visit in their WSL return on October 1.\n\"There was one moment early on when we lost a couple of games and I thought, 'Oh God, don't get relegated again,'\" she tells Sky Sports with a smile. \"It was a rebuild of everything.\n\"Over that first summer I was adding to our list of players who would fit into the club every day and replacing others when they were signed by other clubs.\n\"I felt like I was getting nowhere for a while - but then we started getting bodies in the door and it picked up very quickly.\n\"Because it was my first role, I was really proud of being a head coach, and grateful. A bit scared, maybe let's call that terrified, but it did feel like a chance to try new things and do something different.\n\"We're seeing the positive effects of that now. Brooke Aspin and Naomi Layzell, two of many players we pulled from the academy and development teams, have now got two years of first-team football off the back of that.\nWho have Bristol City signed this summer?

We've got a real good group of young players who haven't just been on the fringes, they've been right in the thick of it for two seasons.\"\nSmith built a team with a point to prove, and achieved it in style by thrashing Charlton 4-0 in April to finally seal their promotion to the WSL.\nShe doesn't even remember the second half of that game, the memories of that empty squad list through to winning the title too overwhelming to cope.\nBut once the taste of success had sunk in, it was back to the whiteboard to recruit for this season - and another batch of hungry players, keen to show why bigger clubs had been wrong to let them out of their grasp.\n\"All of the signings we've made are about everybody wanting a real opportunity again,\" Smith says. \"There's a door open here, who wants it the most? We've built a really positive squad off the back of that.\n\"The reason we've signed the players we have, and kept the players we have, is because they've got a bit between their teeth, a point to prove, a bit of resilience.

Last year, City won 15 of their 22 Championship games.\nThey could conceivably lose that many this season and still stay up, but if the Robins let defeats affect their morale, they will struggle. Smith uses last season's surprise survivors Leicester, who lost their first nine games before a stunning revival, as an example to follow.\n\"Leicester did it really well last year after Christmas, they spun the whole thing on its head - they were already down, try to fight to get out of it. We can start that way as well.\n\"We do have targets in some aspects around our performance goals, the players have their own too which we don't share publicly. But for me, it's really important not just to focus on the win or the draw, if you look at how Leicester survived last year, the whole style of play changed, they had a bit of belief.\n\"You can't just look at the result at the end and get either bogged down or too high with it. That's how we take it on too.\"\nEven looking beyond the scoreline, a narrow defeat to Manchester City in their opening friendly - after being smashed 14-1 by Gareth Taylor's side across two cup games last season - was cause for cautious optimism within the City hierarchy, who felt an additional level of respect from their big-spending opponents.\nInstagram Due to your consent preferences, you\u2019re not able to view this.

It is the last remaining hospital in its geographic area of operation.\nWe are not naming the hospital or its location to protect its staff and patients.\nSo far, neither the military nor the air force have been able to find the hospital, as it is well-hidden beneath the jungle canopy and built into the side of a mountain.\nThis hospital is the subject of a new Sky News current affairs programme, The Last Hospital: 30 Days in Myanmar.\nThe programme tells the story of the work of the medical staff saving lives on the frontline against all odds and explores attacks on other medical facilities in Myanmar.\nThere are more than a dozen bomb shelters dotted around the hospital, one of them is directly attached to a ward housing multiple amputees. That is how seriously they take the threat.\nImage: A bomb shelter built into the hillside\nA surgeon at the hospital, known by his revolutionary name Dr Vincent, narrowly survived a military bomb attack on the sister hospital to the secret hospital.\n\"When they attacked us, we had to run and hide in a bomb shelter we had built, then we had to get the patients to safety,\" he told me.\n\"The first bomb missed by a few hundred metres, so we all had time to get to safety before the next bomb struck, this time hitting the hospital, it was terrifying, I still have PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) as a result, and I live in fear even now.\"\n\"It was a targeted attack, they knew we're a hospital,\" he added.\nThe Myanmar Witness report identified four attacked hospitals for closer investigation. One of them, in Shan State, is the Kayan National Health Committee (KNHC) medical facility, referred to locally as the Saung Phee.\nImage: Shrapnel damage at the Kayan National Health Committee medical facility\nWe visited this hospital when we were in the country and can confirm the hospital was indeed destroyed - it looked like the patients and staff had literally run for their lives.\nThe hospital windows were all blown out, the walls were peppered with shrapnel, and there was glass and debris everywhere.\nIn one of the rooms a needle still sat in a bottle of medicine, as if it was about to be dispensed, and in the wards drips still hung from the sides of hospital beds.\nSky News spoke to a survivor and eyewitness to the attack on this medical facility.\nWe found Asumpte in a refugee camp with her family. She had given birth in the now bombed-out hospital just before it was attacked on 25 April.\nTwo other new mums on her ward were killed.\nHolding her newborn, she told us she didn't think the hospital would be attacked because it's a hospital, and that they didn't know the bombs were coming.\n\"I ran as soon as the first bomb dropped. There were people who got hit, although there were many more who were injured, everybody was just running around,\" she told me.\nPlease use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player 5:41 What's happening in Myanmar?\nThe Myanmar Witness report concludes that the Myanmar military is attacking medical facilities, as it \"struggles to maintain control and quell opposition across the country\".\nThe targeting of hospitals and medical facilities is illegal, the report adds.\n\"It is clear that the conflict is having a sustained and long-term impact on civilians' access to medical support.\"\nBe the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free\nSky News concluded from its visit that the targeting of medical facilities, places of worship, and schools by the Myanmar junta was a regular occurrence.\nThe junta continues to deny these attacks are happening, dismissing it all as propaganda.\nYou can watch The Last Hospital: 30 Days In Myanmar on Wednesday 20 September on Sky Documentaries and on Thursday 21 September on Sky News.", "url": "https://news.sky.com/story/myanmar-military-junta-deliberately-bombing-medical-facilities-with-secret-jungle-hospital-now-being-sought-12965090", "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/23/09/1600x900/skynews-myanmar-last-hospital_6290854.jpg?20230919165615", "publishedAt": "2023-09-20T08:40:00Z", "source": {"name": "Sky News", "url": "https://news.sky.com"}}, {"title": "A win-win situation: The fullback transaction that ignited two clubs", "description": "The sliding doors moment involving Reece Walsh and Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad is a rare example of a player transaction where all parties won.", "content": "It was a sliding doors moment that worked for all parties involved and it's been a key factor in both the Broncos and Warriors ending five-year finals droughts to meet in a preliminary final this Saturday night at Suncorp Stadium.\nOn June 6 last year the signing of Charnze Nicoll-Klokstad on a three-year deal gave the Kiwi club the comfort they needed to grant Reece Walsh an early release from his contract to join the Broncos and he left Auckland at the conclusion of that campaign.\nTwelve months on from parting ways with a likely generational talent at fullback, it can be said with all sincerity that the Warriors have lost nothing in that position throughout season 2023.\nThe two players sit at near opposite ends of the NRL fullback spectrum in terms of their style and strengths and have each become ideal fits for their respective sides.\nWalsh, in the infancy of his career, is high risk and high reward. But the current Brisbane squad is built in such a way that they have been able to absorb the pressure created by his NRL-high 36 handling errors, which have come alongside 31 direct try involvements.\nIn a settled side with a star-studded forward pack who can do the grunt work for him, the 21-year-old has returned to his junior club and added another dimension to their attack, forming a lethal three-pronged combination with Adam Reynolds and Ezra Mam.\nWhile Nicoll-Klokstad doesn't have the same athletic gifts or ability to influence the attack on that level, the Warriors don't need him to.\nInstead he brings a running game second only to Dylan Edwards in terms of fullbacks \u2013 which has been vital to his side holding their own despite having a generally undersized forward pack \u2013 while he's been a steady hand who's made minimal errors for a new-look side with a rookie head coach.\nIt may be looked at differently in time, but right now there have been no losers in this according to the man who pulled the trigger on the sequence of events.\n\"There\u2019s no other way of looking at it. It worked out really well for both players,\" Warriors CEO Cameron George told NRL.com.\n\"Reece wasn\u2019t going anywhere unless we found a suitable replacement. Not just a replacement, but a person that we deemed to be an equal contributor to our footy club and when Charnze\u2019s name came across my desk it just made so much sense.\n\"I wouldn\u2019t trade Charnze for anybody in the competition.\"\nAt the heart of the decision for both players was family.\nIt allowed Walsh to return to Brisbane and be closer to daughter Leila, while Nicoll-Klokstad was ready to get home after four seasons in Canberra and is now settled with wife Alexis and sons Rio and Kyrie.\n\"I had a really nice moment with my wife before the game [against the Knights last week] and had some reflection on how the last 12 months have been,\" Nicoll-Klokstad told NRL.com.\nUp Next / Cancel Replay Play Next CNK came to play!\n\"Especially how it ended in Canberra to where it is now. This time last year I was in reserve grade not being too sure how being back home was going to be.\n\"Fast forward 12 months and we are thriving. We are in our own home and real happy, our marriage is thriving and footy is just icing on the cake.\"\nHaving missed their prior meeting in Round 13 this year due to being in camp with the Maroons, this Saturday marks Walsh's first opportunity to take on the club who gave him the first 38 appearances of his NRL career.\nHaving since gone on to become an Origin player and live up to the billing placed on him as one of the game's best young talents, he remains grateful for the role the club played in his development.\n\"When I went there I was a fresh teenager and ready to learn,\" Walsh said.\n\"All I wanted to do was play NRL. They gave that to me and they will always hold a soft spot in my heart.\n\"I made some really good relationships there on and off the field... I don't regret [leaving], but it was hard to leave.\nUp Next / Cancel Replay Play Next Reece Walsh steps up\n\"Looking back at it now, where the two clubs are and where Charnze is now and where I am, we wouldn't take it back for anything.\n\"I think it has worked out for both [clubs] pretty good.\"", "url": "https://www.nrl.com/news/2023/09/20/a-win-win-situation-the-fullback-transaction-that-ignied-two-clubs/", "image": "https://www.nrl.com/siteassets/2023/2023-nrl-season/finals-week-3/nrl23_walsh-v-nicoll-klokstad-1.jpg?center=0.304%2C0.496&preset=share", "publishedAt": "2023-09-20T08:01:21Z", "source": {"name": "NRL.COM", "url": "https://www.nrl.com"}}, {"title": "Who wants to be a millionaire? 3 ASX shares I think could make it happen", "description": "The allure of seven figures drives many punters.
